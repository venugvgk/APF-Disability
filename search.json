    "text": "Autism is a neurodevelopmental condition and the most effective way to work with autism is through a set of therapies. This makes early identification and intervention very important for autism.\nHowever, autism is a spectrum condition, so the symptoms may vary in type and severity from child to child. In addition, since each child develops in his/her own way, some early signs of autism look like they are part of the natural development of the child. Also, Indian families often tend to think that speaking a little late, being a little unresponsive, is nothing to worry about. One often hears things like “oh, his father spoke at three, look he is all fine now!” and “boys start speaking late anyway”.\nAll of this makes early identification and action difficult for parents. Other family members and friends tend to keep their peace till the child is older. Most medical professionals may also advise a wait and watch approach.\nWhile autism can look different in different children, the most common areas of difficulty are communication and interaction with others. Signs of autism can be noticed when the children are around 2-3 years of age or even earlier. Parents and caregivers may watch for these signs.\nWhen you notice any of the following signs in the children around you, it is useful to consult a developmental psychologist or a developmental pediatrician at the earliest. It is possible that these signs do not mean autism, but if they do, then you would have identified the issues a little earlier and started the intervention, thereby helping the child enormously.\n\n\nChildren with Autism may show some early signs of being on the spectrum, such as missing certain developmental milestones / age-appropriate behavior (these vary for each child). For example, the child:\n\nDoes not respond to name by 9 months of age\nDoes not show facial expressions like happy, sad, angry, and surprised by 9 months of age\nDoes not play simple interactive games like pat-a-cake by 12 months of age\nUses few or no gestures by 12 months of age (for example, does not wave goodbye)\nDoes not share interests with others by 15 months of age (for example, shows you an object that they like)\nDoes not point to show you something interesting by 18 months of age\nDoes not notice when others are hurt or upset by 24 months of age\nDoes not notice other children and join them in play by 36 months of age\nDoes not pretend to be something else, like a teacher or superhero, during play by 48 months of age\nDoes not sing, dance, or act for you by 60 months of age\n\n\n\n\nAbout 40% of kids with autism spectrum disorders don’t talk at all, and between 25% and 30% develop some language skills during infancy but then lose them later. Some children with ASD start talking later in life.\nMost have some problems with communication, including:\n\nDoes not give or sustain eye contact\n\nDelayed speech and language skills\nFlat, robotic speaking voice, or singsong voice\nEcholalia (repeating the same phrase over and over)\nProblems with pronouns (saying “you” instead of “I,” for example)\nNot using or rarely using common gestures (pointing or waving), and not responding to them\nInability to stay on topic when talking or answering questions\nNot recognizing sarcasm or joking\nTrouble expressing needs and emotions\nNot getting signals from body language, tone of voice, and expressions\n\n\n\n\nPeople with ASD have behaviors or interests that can seem unusual. These behaviors or interests set ASD apart from conditions defined by problems with social communication and interaction only.\nExamples of restricted or repetitive behaviors and interests related to ASD can include\n\nLines up toys or other objects and gets upset when order is changed\nPlays with toys the same way every time\nIs focused on parts of objects (for example, wheels)\nGets upset by minor changes\nHas obsessive interests\nMust follow certain routines\nFlaps hands, rocks body, or spins self in circles\nHas unusual reactions to the way things sound, smell, taste, look, or feel\nFussy eating habits\nLack of coordination, clumsiness\nImpulsiveness (acting without thinking)\nAggressive behavior, both with self and others\nShort attention span\n\n\n\n\nMost people with ASD have other related characteristics. These might include\n\nDelayed movement skills\nDelayed cognitive or learning skills\nHyperactive, impulsive, and/or inattentive behavior\nEpilepsy or seizure disorder\nUnusual eating and sleeping habits\nGastrointestinal issues (for example, constipation)\nUnusual mood or emotional reactions\nAnxiety, stress, or excessive worry\nLack of fear or more fear than expected"

In siblings, who share 50% of their genes, the occurrence of autism in both the siblings (the concordance rate) is 20%. Similarly, in fraternal twins, who share 50% of genes and grow in the same womb, the concordance rate is 31%. However, genetics are not the only causal factor - this is evidenced by the concordance rate of 77% even in identical twins, who share 100% of their genes, and grow in the same womb.\nGenetics play a large role does not mean autism runs in the family. Certain individuals have it brand new because of mutations in the sperm or egg at the time of conception which are not passed down. Also, while we know genetics play a large role, the current studies do not provide information on what genes are involved, or even if it is a combination of genes. Furthermore, A study by Simons Foundation found that the genetic changes/ alterations were different for different individuals even among a population of 2600 that had brand new autism - this means there is not 1 gene, but about 300-400 genes (that are not random, but fit together in a pathway/ network) causing autism - possibly why there is such a wide spectrum of autism."

While there are studies that have found correlation between some environmental factors and the incidence of autism, it is important to note that the research is in early stages. The evidence for some of these factors is strong and for some, it is confusing or weak. While we know some of these factors play a role, we do not know how exactly how that role works. In addition, some factors like air pollution are so generic and so widespread that there is little anyone can do about them. So, while we know in general that there are a variety of environmental factors, we do not have a single, actionable, point that can make a significant difference.\nSome of the environmental factors that have a strong to moderate current evidence are:\n\nthe use of certain medications during pregnancy - Valproic acid (given for epilepsy), Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (Used to treat depression)\n\nextremely preterm birth and low birth weight\nOlder parental age at the time of conception\nBacterial and viral infections in the mother while pregnant\nMaternal autoimmunity\n\nAs of now, we do not exactly know what causes autism. There is much research being conducted on both genetic and environmental causes and the early results are promising. However, if a family has a child on the spectrum now, it might be more important to ask what can help the child rather than what causes autism, since the second question is unlikely to be answered in the near future in a definite way that can change the current ways of managing autism."

    "text": "Origin of the vaccine connection\nIn 1998, a physician by the name Andrew Wakefield made this claim in a paper published in the medical journal Lancet. During that time, the two most popular candidates for the cause of autism were refrigerator parenting and genetics/neurobiology. Wakefield looked at 12 children who were developing normally until the administration of the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine and started exhibiting autistic symptoms shortly after. He believed that the vaccine affected the large intestine and assumed that neurotoxic proteins released through the intestine reached the bloodstream and brain, causing autism. His belief was strengthened when all the children he performed colonoscopies on exhibited the lesions.\nThe theory made sense as autism symptoms in children started to appear around the same time as the vaccine administration i.e. 12 to15 months of age. “It was after the vaccine that my child stopped talking/ started behaving this way” is a common refrain one hears even today. The theory also gained popularity with parents as it took away the burden of blame from them. Autism cases were increasing rapidly, people were looking for a cause, and this plausible theory gained credence."

    "text": "Debunking the theory\nThe vaccine link looked obvious and was convenient but other researchers were unable to replicate the findings. Also, considering the diversity of how autism presents itself, a common biological cause looked unlikely to the scientists. In 2005, an investigative reporter alerted the editors at Lancet that Wakefield’s study had been flawed by severe research misconduct, conflict of interests, and falsehood.\nAfter investigating the matter, Lancet retracted the article, and the British Medical Association took disciplinary actions against Wakefield. Since then, any direct connection between autism and the MMR vaccine has been discredited by dozens of studies investigating the roots of autism and the biological effects of MMR and the mumps virus. Also, even as more parents were opting out of MMR vaccination, the rates of autism had been rising.\nSoon after, there was a suspicion about another autism-vaccine link. It was suspected that thimerosal, added to vaccines as a preservative, could cause autism. Thimerosal contains mercury, a poison, but there was no evidence that the small amount was harmful. To see if thimerosal was linked to autism, researchers studied children who received vaccines that contained it. They compared them to kids who received vaccines that did not contain thimerosal and did not find significant differences in the rates of autism. Even then, thimerosal was taken out of most vaccines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince 2003, there have been nine studies funded or conducted by CDC (Center for Disease Control) that have found no link between thimerosal-containing vaccines and ASD (autism spectrum disorder). These studies also found no link between the MMR vaccine and ASD in children.\n\n\n\nResearchers have also looked to see if all the vaccines required before age 2 together somehow triggered autism. Children receive 25 shots in the first 15 months of life. Some people feared that getting all those shots so early in life could lead to the development of autism but there is no evidence that this is true. The CDC compared groups of children who received vaccines on the recommended schedule and those whose vaccines were delayed or did not get them at all. There was no difference in the autism rate between these groups.\nThus, through these several scientific studies, it has been concluded that there is no evident link between vaccines and autism."

Some studies suggest that increased screen time is associated with melanopsin-expressing neurons and decreasing gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmitter, and thus results in deviant behavior, decreased cognitive, and language development. This has been termed virtual autism.\nWhile the symptoms are similar, and virtual autism may be diagnosed as autism, these are two different conditions. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition with genetic links and is thus present lifelong. On the other hand, virtual autism has a definite cause, which is excessive screen exposure at an early age/ Intensive Early Screen Exposure and unlike ASD, can be reversed if intervened at the right time and with the right corrective measures.\nThere is no evidence that the autism spectrum disorder is caused by excessive screen time."

As we have discussed before, autism is neurodevelopmental and has genetic links. If a child is getting a diagnosis, it is because the child has always had autism. It may be diagnosed late due to various other factors (denial from parents, symptoms being masked etc.) Your child is not diagnosed with autism because he/she was spending time with another child who has autism.\nIn summary, some popular beliefs, or apprehensions about the cause of autism have been conclusively proved to be wrong and an awareness of these can help parents focus their time and energy on more useful approaches to dealing with their children’s autism."

    "text": "As people who are dealing with or working with disabilities, we naturally want to learn more about specific disabilities, be it autism, vision impairment, hearing impairment etc. However, it may make sense to step back to try and understand the concept of disability.\nThere has been much social and political discourse around the concept of disability in the last few decades. The discourse includes questions like what does ‘disability’ mean and what does it identify, what are its causes and consequences, and what should be an appropriate response to disability at an individual and societal level.\nMuch of this debate has focused on removing or reforming the conventional social definitions and attitudes that have defined disability in terms of pathology or a deficit. Such ‘deficit approach’ to disability, based on medical models of impairments with hard notions of pathology, has led to responses that invoke charity and pity at best. More commonly, such approaches have led to stigma, exclusion or marginalisation of persons identified as disabled.\nThe response to this has been to move away from the medical models and to take views that consider disability to be wholly socially constructed and the result primarily of social stigma and discrimination. Many activists reject the concept of disability itself as unhelpful, and advocate terms that remove any implication of essential differences that the relevant groups are supposed to carry.\nIn this note, and throughout the accompanying resources, we see a balance between these two views. We do not reject the use of disability as a descriptor. For example, we will not reject the use of “Dyslexic” as a descriptor just because it comes from a medical model of the deficiency referring to the inability to read words. However, we do not believe the differences in human abilities themselves define disability. Most of these human abilities lie along a spectrum and it is impossible to identify or assign disability without reference to context and environmental conditions. For example, someone with dyslexia would be more disabled as a newspaper editor and not as disabled as a crane operator. It may be important to emphasize here that we do not use the words ‘disability’ and ‘disabled’ as medical terms.\nHuman beings have psycho-social abilities and characteristics that lie along a spectrum. Any atypicality or differences in these individual abilities may diminish the personal and social functioning of the individual. This may be worsened by the social conditions, including the built environment, the structure of opportunities that society presents to various groups or the attitudes, feelings, and actions the individual confronts in the people around.\nWhen seen this way, ‘disability’ is a status descriptor that attaches to a person and\n\nIdentifies that there are limitations in the person’s functioning in the world\nlocates the limitations in the interaction between the person’s physical or psychological characteristics and the social environment\nacknowledges that it may actually or potentially diminish the person’s wellbeing.\n\n\n\n\nThe Indvidual identified as disabled, or their immediate caregivers might initiate their own responses to adapt to the challenges arising out of the disability. In addition, disability calls for moral responses that include the duty of care and concern that is expected both out of the primary caregivers and the society at large, including policy responses. The notion of care is not meant as a response of pity or compassion. It is the idea of an ethic of care that is part of a broader set of moral considerations, including respect, responsibility, inclusion, and justice.\nThus, our understanding of disability is an affirmative model in the sense that disability is not automatically assumed to be socially crippling. Similarly, the responses to disability are also assumed to be within the range of diversity that can be accepted, responded to and managed by the society. On the other hand, we do not adopt a view that all disability is necessarily socially constructed, which places the onus of response entirely on social values and systems.\nIn summary, the broad set of value orientations that we adopt for designing responses include:\n\nEvery person who is suspected to be atypical in their repertoire of capacities should have, if they so wish, access to expert assistance in the evaluation and identification of characteristics that might amount to a disability. This is especially important in the case of marginalised and socio-economically disadvantaged communities.\nOnce identified, the person and their primary caregivers must have access to advice and support to help understand how the disability might influence or limit the person’s functioning unless actively addressed. In this, we adopt a bio-psycho-social approach to the analysis of disability.\nThe person must have access to the best expertise that society can currently offer, to ameliorate the impact of the underlying condition that constitutes the disability. Depending on the nature of the disability, responses may range from medical attention to correctable conditions to psychotherapy and at the other end, social and policy accommodations that reduce or eliminate the limitations imposed by the context.\n\nThis view adopts values that do not see disability as natural disadvantage. Disadvantages are largely constituted by social responses. A social orientation that values respect, inclusion, responsibility, and justice will expand the range of disability that can be easily accommodated within normal social life.\nThis view also acknowledges that prejudice and ignorance may make social structures and processes less inclusive of disabilities. So systematic attempts to remove stigma and gaps in knowledge that prevent inclusion is a necessary component of possible responses. A long and sustained programme of advocacy that tackles systemic exclusion and leads to more conducive social policy environment is equally important."

Many activists reject the concept of disability itself as unhelpful, and advocate terms that remove any implication of essential differences that the relevant groups are supposed to carry.\nIn this note, and throughout the accompanying resources, we see a balance between these two views. We do not reject the use of disability as a descriptor. For example, we will not reject the use of “Dyslexic” as a descriptor just because it comes from a medical model of the deficiency referring to the inability to read words. However, we do not believe the differences in human abilities themselves define disability. Most of these human abilities lie along a spectrum and it is impossible to identify or assign disability without reference to context and environmental conditions. For example, someone with dyslexia would be more disabled as a newspaper editor and not as disabled as a crane operator. It may be important to emphasize here that we do not use the words ‘disability’ and ‘disabled’ as medical terms.\nHuman beings have psycho-social abilities and characteristics that lie along a spectrum. Any atypicality or differences in these individual abilities may diminish the personal and social functioning of the individual. This may be worsened by the social conditions, including the built environment, the structure of opportunities that society presents to various groups or the attitudes, feelings, and actions the individual confronts in the people around.\nWhen seen this way, ‘disability’ is a status descriptor that attaches to a person and\n\nIdentifies that there are limitations in the person’s functioning in the world\nlocates the limitations in the interaction between the person’s physical or psychological characteristics and the social environment\nacknowledges that it may actually or potentially diminish the person’s wellbeing."

    "text": "The Indvidual identified as disabled, or their immediate caregivers might initiate their own responses to adapt to the challenges arising out of the disability. In addition, disability calls for moral responses that include the duty of care and concern that is expected both out of the primary caregivers and the society at large, including policy responses. The notion of care is not meant as a response of pity or compassion. It is the idea of an ethic of care that is part of a broader set of moral considerations, including respect, responsibility, inclusion, and justice.\nThus, our understanding of disability is an affirmative model in the sense that disability is not automatically assumed to be socially crippling. Similarly, the responses to disability are also assumed to be within the range of diversity that can be accepted, responded to and managed by the society. On the other hand, we do not adopt a view that all disability is necessarily socially constructed, which places the onus of response entirely on social values and systems.\nIn summary, the broad set of value orientations that we adopt for designing responses include:\n\nEvery person who is suspected to be atypical in their repertoire of capacities should have, if they so wish, access to expert assistance in the evaluation and identification of characteristics that might amount to a disability. This is especially important in the case of marginalised and socio-economically disadvantaged communities.\nOnce identified, the person and their primary caregivers must have access to advice and support to help understand how the disability might influence or limit the person’s functioning unless actively addressed. In this, we adopt a bio-psycho-social approach to the analysis of disability.\nThe person must have access to the best expertise that society can currently offer, to ameliorate the impact of the underlying condition that constitutes the disability. Depending on the nature of the disability, responses may range from medical attention to correctable conditions to psychotherapy and at the other end, social and policy accommodations that reduce or eliminate the limitations imposed by the context.\n\nThis view adopts values that do not see disability as natural disadvantage. Disadvantages are largely constituted by social responses. A social orientation that values respect, inclusion, responsibility, and justice will expand the range of disability that can be easily accommodated within normal social life.\nThis view also acknowledges that prejudice and ignorance may make social structures and processes less inclusive of disabilities. So systematic attempts to remove stigma and gaps in knowledge that prevent inclusion is a necessary component of possible responses. A long and sustained programme of advocacy that tackles systemic exclusion and leads to more conducive social policy environment is equally important."

    "text": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a way to talk about a group of complex brain-related conditions. These conditions can make it harder for people to communicate and behave in typical ways. In other words, it affects how they talk, interact with others, and act in various situations. Autism is called a “spectrum” since ASD can affect people differently, with some individuals experiencing milder challenges and others more significant ones. There are a range of possibilities, with each person’s experience being unique.\n\n\nAutism in children usually becomes noticeable around the age of 2 to 3 years, all though with increasing awareness, early identification is becoming more common these days.\nParents initially start noticing differences in the way the child plays, communicates and responds to the environment. Many children do not respond to their name or make eye contact. They may not use any words or stop using the few words they have been using till then. They may not be interested in the usual things other children are interested in. They may seem to be obsessed with some unusual ways of occupying themselves like watching fans go round and round, flapping their hands, rocking themselves, singing to themselves constantly, lining up play things etc.\nChildren often show unusual amounts of distress when they are disturbed or they need to go from one activity to the other. They appear preoccupied and may not notice the presence of other children or adults around them. Parents typically struggle to understand why the child is in constant distress.The child appears adamant, uncommunicative and becomes unmanageable.\nUsually this is the time when parents seek help from medical professionals. Pediatricians refer children to developmental pediatricians or developmental psychologists. The child may initially be identified to have a developmental delay and eventually handed a diagnosis of being on the Autism Spectrum.\n\n\n\nCurrently, we do not know the exact cause of autism, though the research points to a variety of factors – genetic, bilological and environmental - contributing to it. Since autism is caused by a variety of factors working together, and currently we do not understand which specific factors are working together in which specific ways to cause autism, there is no medical way to “cure” autism. However, with the help of various therapies, many people on the spectrum can learn to manage autism to a large extent, and with the help of caregivers, lead fulfilling lives.\n\n\n\nThe immediate implication of autism diagnosis for the parents is that they need to rethink their ideas of parenting and their expectations of the child. Children on the spectrum may have various neurological and physiological differences that cause them to experience the world very differently from other people. Parents need to be willing to learn about their child and how autism impacts them. They need to be open to learning about various therapies and educational approaches in order to learn to manage themselves and the child.\nIn the Indian context, where support from public institutions may be limited, a diagnosis of autism for the child may require the parents to radically rethink their lifestyle and goals. They may need to plan their lives such that one of the parents spends time with the child and coordinates with the doctors, therapists, school and other people who interact with the child.\n\n\n\nOnce there is a diagnosis, the next thing to do is to think of various ways to start working with the child. This usually takes the form of therapies - behavior therapies to start learning to understand and manage the general behavior of the child; speech and language therapy to start a channel of communication; occupational therapy or physical activities to help the child with physical regulation. The specific things that are done in each of the therapies depend on the specific challenges and needs of the child.\nWhichever of these therapies are chosen, one needs to ensure the therapies are aimed at making life easier for the child and the family. Over a period of time, the therapies are supposed to build the skills and competencies of the child, show the family how to work with the child, and over all, add to the quality of life of the family.\nIt also helps if parents continue to be involved in the therapies, understand the processes and learn the basic approaches, so that the child gets the same support whenever s/he needs it.\n\n\n\nSchooling and educational needs may vary according to the child’s capabilities, difficulties, needs and interests. Thus, it is important to first develop an Individualised Education Plan (IEP) for the child based on his/her strengths and difficulties. The IEP generally takes into account the strengths and difficulties of the child, as seen by different people working with the child - parents, therapists, teachers etc. - and outlines a plan to equip the child with required competencies.\nDepending on the specific needs of the child, a child may go on to a mainstream school with accommodations or go to a special school. Some children may need additional help. Homeschooling may also be an option in some cases.\n\n\n\nThe challenge with autism is that it is a spectrum condition, meaning it shows up in different ways in different people. The symptoms of autism may occur together or separately, with varying degrees of severity. This makes it difficult to characterize autism in a single uniform way. As they say, everyone’s autism is different and if you have seen one person with autism, you have only seen one person with autism.\nFor example, autism can cause severe coordination issues making a person unable to coordinate physical movements, leading to severe limitations in moving around, speaking and other motor planning activities. Autism may occur along with other neurological conditions like epilepsy. It can come along with conditions like anxiety, intellectual impairment, clinical depression, etc.\nEach of these difficulties may need to be addressed in specific ways. Finding these therapies and educational approaches, paying for them and practicing them may become overwhelming for the family. There is also a social aspect to this - the family may not have much time and energy to socialize and may also face some social resistance.\nOne of the significant issues a family faces as the child grows up is to be able to continue to understand, relate to and work with the person he/she is becoming. Another difficulty is to find people and institutions that can provide help and support as the person grows up to be a young adult. In India, most therapy centers work with young children up to 8-10 years of age. Most schools - either mainstream or special - expect 16 year olds to graduate and go out. There are very few institutions that provide meaningful alternatives and support beyond the teenage years.\n\n\n\nChildren with autism grow up to be adults with autism. While they do learn to manage their autism and be able to deal with the world in their own different ways, they will continue to have autism and may also need to have continued support.\nWhen one looks at the variety of difficulties, their varying levels and the different combinations they occur in, it stands to reason that there is a spectrum of outcomes as children grow up into adults. Some children grow up to be adults that need to depend on caregivers for basic health, hygiene and safety. Some children grow up to be adults that may be able to manage their own in controlled settings like homes and sheltered work spaces. Some children grow up to be able to physically manage themselves but may need continued emotional support to deal with the anxiety of being different from everyone else. A few children grow up to be able to manage like everyone else.\nAt present, the support and employment opportunities for autistic adults in India are still evolving and will need significant strengthening as we go forward."

Autism has been a poorly understood condition whose cause is not clearly known. It impacts children and it is no secret that many of us do not understand parenting, education and child development well enough. When a child is diagnosed with autism, parents do not immediately understand all the implications and its lifelong impact. Many see it as improper behavior on the child’s part or a set of symptoms that are preventing the child from going to school and seek to address them quickly, in time for the child to join a school. They also hear from healthcare professionals that there is no medical cure for autism. The evidence based interventions are behavioral, requiring significant time, energy and resource commitment from everyone involved. Most people are stressed out with the effort of bringing up the child and an autism diagnosis just makes things worse.\nIt is in such an environment that alternative approaches, promising cures or at least significant improvements quickly, with little or no effort, become popular. Some of these are approaches that work for another condition, e.g. chelation, which is a treatment for heavy metal toxicity. Chelation was tried for autism initially because symptoms of autism resembled mercury poisoning and later because people believed autism was caused by mercury from vaccines. Similarly, hyperbaric oxygen therapy works for traumatic brain injury and was tried for autism because people believed increasing oxygen supply to the brain can help autism. There is homeopathy, which has been tried for everything that is not well understood in current medical science. In the Indian context, there is ayurveda, siddha and other alternative systems offering everything from remedies to cures for autism. Many others like restrictive diets are approaches that claim to cure a wide variety of conditions."

This has been useful to treat heavy metal toxicity. Most commonly used medications are dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA).

The use of Chelation therapy in humans started between the 1950s and 1960s when it was used in patients with hypercalcemia and lead poisoning, consequently showing improvements in their cardiovascular condition. Since then it has been established as an effective treatment for lead poisoning or any heavy metal toxicity for that matter and as anticoagulants. Between 2002 and 2007, despite several warnings and prohibitions by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration), chelation gained popularity in the U.S. for treating heart conditions and other health issues.\nHowever, due to its intensity and potential harmful side effects, it is strictly administered under medical supervision. In 1989, a “Protocol for the Safe and Effective Administration of EDTA” was established and later updated. This comprehensive protocol establishes strict criteria for patient selection and urges clinicians to conduct an initial assessment of renal function using the Cockcroft-Gault equation. It further emphasizes the continuous monitoring of renal function throughout a series of chelation treatments. Additionally, emergency procedures are outlined in case of adverse reactions during the process."

Some studies have suggested that children with autism may have higher levels of certain heavy metals in their systems, but the direct cause between heavy metal exposure and autism has not been established. One hypothesis that autism is caused due to exposure to heavy metals (mercury) through vaccines has been studied thoroughly and research suggests no causal link between vaccines and autism. Other theories of autism being caused due to intrauterine or environmental exposure to heavy metals is still under study and there is no established link as of now.\nOn the other hand, scientific research investigating the effectiveness of chelation therapy for autism remains limited and inconclusive. Clinical trials investigating the impact of chelation on autism symptoms have shown mixed or inconclusive results, and many of these studies have methodological limitations."

The presence of certain metals like calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, chromium, potassium, sodium, and zinc is essential to facilitate normal biological functioning of the human body. It is a cause for concern if there are lower or higher levels of these metals than what is required. It necessitates meticulous and supervised administration of medications to avoid excessive removal of metals. Medical organizations do not recommend chelation therapy for autism due to safety concerns.\nSome researchers also suggest that due to the greater risks associated with chelation compared to its efficacy as a treatment for autism, it is advisable to first establish a definitive causal link between heavy metals and autism. This approach emphasizes the need to first validate the relationship between heavy metal exposure and autism before further studying on chelation as a treatment.\nTherefore, it is crucial for anyone, whether medical professionals or families, considering chelation therapy to conduct a thorough baseline assessment and cost-benefit analysis of the treatment before proceeding with it. There is no medical organization that is in favor of using chelation therapy for autism."

    "text": "Autism\nThis guide deals with autism and various aspects of living with it.\nWe start with an overview of autism outlining the entire autism lifecycle as a precursor. Then we discuss how to identify autism, how common it is, what causes and what does not cause autism.\nIn the next section, we outline a history of autism, starting from early definitions and trace the path down to various developments in understanding and dealing with autism.\nWe then present perspectives of people living with autism, including people on the spectrum, families living with autism, medical professionals, and social workers. We attempot to cover the lifecycle of autism by including perspectives from different age groups.\nIn the next section, we address the diagnosis process starting from the need to diagnosis to the actual process of getting a diagnosis. We also include diagnosis for older people.\nIn the next two sections, we outline the immediate steps a family can take when they receive a diagnosis and proceed to explore various approaches to early intervention.\nWe then strike a cautionary note as we talk about alternative approaches to autism that are consider ineffective and sometimes, dangerous. This is done to ensure we provide all the necessary information.\nWe then proceed to education and schooling where we examine the goals and approaches to education and schooling in the Indian context.\nThe next section covers employment where we outline how people on the spectrum can train for work. We also provide some resources that can help them find and keep work.\nThe final section deals with being an adult on the spectrum."
