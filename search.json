    "text": "Autism is a neurodevelopmental condition and the most effective way to work with autism is through a set of therapies. This makes early identification and intervention very important for autism.\nHowever, autism is a spectrum condition, so the symptoms may vary in type and severity from child to child. In addition, since each child develops in his/her own way, some early signs of autism look like they are part of the natural development of the child. Also, Indian families often tend to think that speaking a little late, being a little unresponsive, is nothing to worry about. One often hears things like “oh, his father spoke at three, look he is all fine now!” and “boys start speaking late anyway”.\nAll of this makes early identification and action difficult for parents. Other family members and friends tend to keep their peace till the child is older. Most medical professionals may also advise a wait and watch approach.\nWhile autism can look different in different children, the most common areas of difficulty are communication and interaction with others. Signs of autism can be noticed when the children are around 2-3 years of age or even earlier. Parents and caregivers may watch for these signs.\nWhen you notice any of the following signs in the children around you, it is useful to consult a developmental psychologist or a developmental pediatrician at the earliest. It is possible that these signs do not mean autism, but if they do, then you would have identified the issues a little earlier and started the intervention, thereby helping the child enormously.\n\n\nChildren with Autism may show some early signs of being on the spectrum, such as missing certain developmental milestones / age-appropriate behavior (these vary for each child). For example, the child:\n\nDoes not respond to name by 9 months of age\nDoes not show facial expressions like happy, sad, angry, and surprised by 9 months of age\nDoes not play simple interactive games like pat-a-cake by 12 months of age\nUses few or no gestures by 12 months of age (for example, does not wave goodbye)\nDoes not share interests with others by 15 months of age (for example, shows you an object that they like)\nDoes not point to show you something interesting by 18 months of age\nDoes not notice when others are hurt or upset by 24 months of age\nDoes not notice other children and join them in play by 36 months of age\nDoes not pretend to be something else, like a teacher or superhero, during play by 48 months of age\nDoes not sing, dance, or act for you by 60 months of age\n\n\n\n\nAbout 40% of kids with autism spectrum disorders don’t talk at all, and between 25% and 30% develop some language skills during infancy but then lose them later. Some children with ASD start talking later in life.\nMost have some problems with communication, including:\n\nDoes not give or sustain eye contact\n\nDelayed speech and language skills\nFlat, robotic speaking voice, or singsong voice\nEcholalia (repeating the same phrase over and over)\nProblems with pronouns (saying “you” instead of “I,” for example)\nNot using or rarely using common gestures (pointing or waving), and not responding to them\nInability to stay on topic when talking or answering questions\nNot recognizing sarcasm or joking\nTrouble expressing needs and emotions\nNot getting signals from body language, tone of voice, and expressions\n\n\n\n\nPeople with ASD have behaviors or interests that can seem unusual. These behaviors or interests set ASD apart from conditions defined by problems with social communication and interaction only.\nExamples of restricted or repetitive behaviors and interests related to ASD can include\n\nLines up toys or other objects and gets upset when order is changed\nPlays with toys the same way every time\nIs focused on parts of objects (for example, wheels)\nGets upset by minor changes\nHas obsessive interests\nMust follow certain routines\nFlaps hands, rocks body, or spins self in circles\nHas unusual reactions to the way things sound, smell, taste, look, or feel\nFussy eating habits\nLack of coordination, clumsiness\nImpulsiveness (acting without thinking)\nAggressive behavior, both with self and others\nShort attention span\n\n\n\n\nMost people with ASD have other related characteristics. These might include\n\nDelayed movement skills\nDelayed cognitive or learning skills\nHyperactive, impulsive, and/or inattentive behavior\nEpilepsy or seizure disorder\nUnusual eating and sleeping habits\nGastrointestinal issues (for example, constipation)\nUnusual mood or emotional reactions\nAnxiety, stress, or excessive worry\nLack of fear or more fear than expected",

    "text": "Genetic Factors\nGenetics plays a large role in the incidence of autism, as evidenced by a 2019 study of more than 2 million people across five countries, which estimated ASD’s heritability to be approximately 80%.\nThe role of genetics is also indicated by the concordance rate (both of two siblings having autism). In siblings, who share 50% of their genes, the occurrence of autism in both the siblings (the concordance rate) is 20%. Similarly, in fraternal twins, who share 50% of genes and grow in the same womb, the concordance rate is 31%. However, genetics are not the only causal factor - this is evidenced by the concordance rate of 77% even in identical twins, who share 100% of their genes, and grow in the same womb.\nHere is a TED talk by Wendy Chung where she talks about genetic factors in autism.\n\nGenetics play a large role does not mean autism runs in the family. Certain individuals have it brand new because of mutations in the sperm or egg at the time of conception which are not passed down. Also, while we know genetics play a large role, the current studies do not provide information on what genes are involved, or even if it is a combination of genes. Furthermore, A study by Simons Foundation found that the genetic changes/ alterations were different for different individuals even among a population of 2600 that had brand new autism - this means there is not 1 gene, but about 300-400 genes (that are not random, but fit together in a pathway/ network) causing autism - possibly why there is such a wide spectrum of autism.",

    "text": "Environmental Factors\nA variety of environmental factors have been examined for their contribution to autism. While there are studies that have found correlation between some environmental factors and the incidence of autism, it is important to note that the research is in early stages. The evidence for some of these factors is strong and for some, it is confusing or weak. While we know some of these factors play a role, we do not know how exactly how that role works. In addition, some factors like air pollution are so generic and so widespread that there is little anyone can do about them. So, while we know in general that there are a variety of environmental factors, we do not have a single, actionable, point that can make a significant difference.\nSome of the environmental factors that have a strong to moderate current evidence are:\n\nthe use of certain medications during pregnancy - Valproic acid (given for epilepsy), Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (Used to treat depression)\n\nextremely preterm birth and low birth weight\nOlder parental age at the time of conception\nBacterial and viral infections in the mother while pregnant\nMaternal autoimmunity\n\nAs of now, we do not exactly know what causes autism. There is much research being conducted on both genetic and environmental causes and the early results are promising. However, if a family has a child on the spectrum now, it might be more important to ask what can help the child rather than what causes autism, since the second question is unlikely to be answered in the near future in a definite way that can change the current ways of managing autism.",

    "text": "Origin of the vaccine connection\nIn 1998, a physician by the name Andrew Wakefield made this claim in a paper published in the medical journal Lancet. During that time, the two most popular candidates for the cause of autism were refrigerator parenting and genetics/neurobiology. Wakefield looked at 12 children who were developing normally until the administration of the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine and started exhibiting autistic symptoms shortly after. He believed that the vaccine affected the large intestine and assumed that neurotoxic proteins released through the intestine reached the bloodstream and brain, causing autism. His belief was strengthened when all the children he performed colonoscopies on exhibited the lesions.\nThe theory made sense as autism symptoms in children started to appear around the same time as the vaccine administration i.e. 12 to15 months of age. “It was after the vaccine that my child stopped talking/ started behaving this way” is a common refrain one hears even today. The theory also gained popularity with parents as it took away the burden of blame from them. Autism cases were increasing rapidly, people were looking for a cause, and this plausible theory gained credence.",

    "section": "Debunking the theory",
    "text": "Debunking the theory\nThe vaccine link looked obvious and was convenient but other researchers were unable to replicate the findings. Also, considering the diversity of how autism presents itself, a common biological cause looked unlikely to the scientists. In 2005, an investigative reporter alerted the editors at Lancet that Wakefield’s study had been flawed by severe research misconduct, conflict of interests, and falsehood.\nAfter investigating the matter, Lancet retracted the article, and the British Medical Association took disciplinary actions against Wakefield. Since then, any direct connection between autism and the MMR vaccine has been discredited by dozens of studies investigating the roots of autism and the biological effects of MMR and the mumps virus. Also, even as more parents were opting out of MMR vaccination, the rates of autism had been rising.\nSoon after, there was a suspicion about another autism-vaccine link. It was suspected that thimerosal, added to vaccines as a preservative, could cause autism. Thimerosal contains mercury, a poison, but there was no evidence that the small amount was harmful. To see if thimerosal was linked to autism, researchers studied children who received vaccines that contained it. They compared them to kids who received vaccines that did not contain thimerosal and did not find significant differences in the rates of autism. Even then, thimerosal was taken out of most vaccines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince 2003, there have been nine studies funded or conducted by CDC (Center for Disease Control) that have found no link between thimerosal-containing vaccines and ASD (autism spectrum disorder). These studies also found no link between the MMR vaccine and ASD in children.\n\n\n\nResearchers have also looked to see if all the vaccines required before age 2 together somehow triggered autism. Children receive 25 shots in the first 15 months of life. Some people feared that getting all those shots so early in life could lead to the development of autism but there is no evidence that this is true. The CDC compared groups of children who received vaccines on the recommended schedule and those whose vaccines were delayed or did not get them at all. There was no difference in the autism rate between these groups.\nThus, through these several scientific studies, it has been concluded that there is no evident link between vaccines and autism.",

Some studies suggest that increased screen time is associated with melanopsin-expressing neurons and decreasing gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmitter, and thus results in deviant behavior, decreased cognitive, and language development. This has been termed virtual autism.\nWhile the symptoms are similar, and virtual autism may be diagnosed as autism, these are two different conditions. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition with genetic links and is thus present lifelong. On the other hand, virtual autism has a definite cause, which is excessive screen exposure at an early age/ Intensive Early Screen Exposure and unlike ASD, can be reversed if intervened at the right time and with the right corrective measures.\nThere is no evidence that the autism spectrum disorder is caused by excessive screen time.",

It may be diagnosed late due to various other factors (denial from parents, symptoms being masked etc.) Your child is not diagnosed with autism because he/she was spending time with another child who has autism.\nIn summary, some popular beliefs, or apprehensions about the cause of autism have been conclusively proved to be wrong and an awareness of these can help parents focus their time and energy on more useful approaches to dealing with their children’s autism.",

    "text": "The case of autism\nMany of these factors seem to be working in the case of people who are willing to try alternative treatments for autism. Autism has been a poorly understood condition whose cause is not clearly known. It impacts children and it is no secret that many of us do not understand parenting, education and child development well enough. When a child is diagnosed with autism, parents do not immediately understand all the implications and its lifelong impact. Many see it as improper behavior on the child’s part or a set of symptoms that are preventing the child from going to school and seek to address them quickly, in time for the child to join a school. They also hear from healthcare professionals that there is no medical cure for autism. The evidence based interventions are behavioral, requiring significant time, energy and resource commitment from everyone involved. Most people are stressed out with the effort of bringing up the child and an autism diagnosis just makes things worse.\nIt is in such an environment that alternative approaches, promising cures or at least significant improvements quickly, with little or no effort, become popular. Some of these are approaches that work for another condition, e.g. chelation, which is a treatment for heavy metal toxicity. Chelation was tried for autism initially because symptoms of autism resembled mercury poisoning and later because people believed autism was caused by mercury from vaccines. Similarly, hyperbaric oxygen therapy works for traumatic brain injury and was tried for autism because people believed increasing oxygen supply to the brain can help autism. There is homeopathy, which has been tried for everything that is not well understood in current medical science. In the Indian context, there is ayurveda, siddha and other alternative systems offering everything from remedies to cures for autism. Many others like restrictive diets are approaches that claim to cure a wide variety of conditions.",

    "text": "What is chelation?\nIn chelation, the aim is to administer medications (chelators) that bind with metals in the body and remove it from the system via urine when the medicine itself is excreted. This has been useful to treat heavy metal toxicity. Most commonly used medications are dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). This treatment is typically administered intravenously or orally under medical supervision following a detailed baseline assessment of metal content in the system, usually with a urine test.",

    "text": "History of chelation\nChelation process dates back to 1935 when it was used as binding and extracting agent of calcium in the dyeing industry. The use of Chelation therapy in humans started between the 1950s and 1960s when it was used in patients with hypercalcemia and lead poisoning, consequently showing improvements in their cardiovascular condition. Since then it has been established as an effective treatment for lead poisoning or any heavy metal toxicity for that matter and as anticoagulants. Between 2002 and 2007, despite several warnings and prohibitions by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration), chelation gained popularity in the U.S. for treating heart conditions and other health issues.\nHowever, due to its intensity and potential harmful side effects, it is strictly administered under medical supervision. In 1989, a “Protocol for the Safe and Effective Administration of EDTA” was established and later updated. This comprehensive protocol establishes strict criteria for patient selection and urges clinicians to conduct an initial assessment of renal function using the Cockcroft-Gault equation. It further emphasizes the continuous monitoring of renal function throughout a series of chelation treatments. Additionally, emergency procedures are outlined in case of adverse reactions during the process.",

    "text": "Why was Chelation tried for autism?\nIt gained attention in the context of autism due to concerns about heavy metal toxicity in the systems of individuals in the spectrum, but scientific research hasn’t supported the theory that autism is caused by heavy metal toxicity. Some studies have suggested that children with autism may have higher levels of certain heavy metals in their systems, but the direct cause between heavy metal exposure and autism has not been established. One hypothesis that autism is caused due to exposure to heavy metals (mercury) through vaccines has been studied thoroughly and research suggests no causal link between vaccines and autism. Other theories of autism being caused due to intrauterine or environmental exposure to heavy metals is still under study and there is no established link as of now.\nOn the other hand, scientific research investigating the effectiveness of chelation therapy for autism remains limited and inconclusive. Clinical trials investigating the impact of chelation on autism symptoms have shown mixed or inconclusive results, and many of these studies have methodological limitations.",

In fact, they are one of the first cells developed during the embryo stage. These cells, under the right environment, have the ability to generate new stem cells and also other cells with specialized functions (blood cells, brain cells, bone cells etc.) Because of this unique feature, stem cells play a key role in the development of newborn children and also in the restorative processes after a disease or an injury. Their ability to self-renew and multiply, ensures an ongoing source of new cells to replace old or injured ones. During the developmental years, this growth is vital for maturing into an adult. Once development is complete, this ongoing growth aids in healing and repairing damaged tissues or organs at a cellular level. These special characteristics make stem cells highly important in regenerative medicine, as they can create entire tissues and organs from just a small group of precursor cells.This characteristic of stem cells has kindled research interest in trying this as a treatment for various diseases.",

    "text": "Why was it tried for autism?\nStem cell therapy has been considered as a potential treatment for autism due to the belief that it might target certain biological mechanisms or symptoms (immune system regulation and inflammation, neural connectivity, etc.) associated with the condition.\nReasons why stem cell therapy is being explored for autism include:\n\nRegenerative Potential: Stem cells possess the capability to transform into various cell types. The idea is that they might aid in repairing or regenerating damaged or dysfunctional cells in the brain or nervous system, potentially impacting autism-related symptoms.\nInflammation and Immune Modulation: Studies suggest that immune system dysregulation or inflammation might contribute to certain cases of autism. Some types of stem cells, particularly mesenchymal stem cells, have shown potential in regulating immune responses and reducing inflammation. Researchers hope that this immune-modulating ability might alleviate certain autism-related symptoms.\nNeuroprotective and Neurotrophic Effects: Stem cells produce substances that support the growth and survival of neurons. Researchers explore whether stem cells could protect existing neurons, encourage neuronal growth, and potentially enhance neural connections in individuals with autism.\nExperimental Nature of Treatment: While conventional treatments for autism primarily focus on behavioral and therapeutic interventions, stem cell therapy is considered experimental. It aims to address potential underlying biological factors that traditional therapies might not directly target.\n\nHowever, it’s essential to understand that while stem cell therapy has shown promise in various medical areas, its effectiveness and safety in treating autism are still being investigated. Clinical trials exploring the safety and potential efficacy of stem cell therapy for autism began in the early 2010s. These trials aimed to investigate the safety, feasibility, and any potential improvements in behavior, communication, and other symptoms associated with autism. It remains an experimental and unproven treatment for autism.\nThe scientific and medical community stress the necessity for further comprehensive research, including well-designed clinical trials, to determine its safety, efficacy, and long-term impact on individuals with autism.",

Many parents have fallen victim to the unethical medical and business practice associated with stem cell treatment.\nAs of 2022, the use of stem cell therapy as a treatment or cure for autism is prohibited in India. This restriction has been implemented due to misleading promotions and false claims. Currently, stem cell therapy for conditions outlined in the National Guideline for Stem Cell Research (NGSCR) 2017, excluding Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT)/ hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), is neither accessible nor permitted. Individuals can only participate in stem cell treatment through a clinical trial if they meet the specified criteria for the trial.\nIn this context, it’s important to highlight that there is currently no clinical evidence validating the effectiveness of stem cell therapy for treating autism. Therefore, any facility claiming otherwise should be approached with caution and careful consideration. The National Medical Council (NMC) calls it professional misconduct when anybody practices, advertises, or promotes stem cell therapy as a treatment or cure for autism.\nGiven these factors, families considering stem cell therapy believing it will lead to significant improvements or a cure for autism need to seriously reconsider and make an informed decision. The only ethical and scientific way to get stem cell therapy is to participate in a well designed clinical trial or study. The path ahead demands a cautious approach to verify the safety, efficacy and long term impacts of the therapy.\nHere is a video created in 2023 by Yash Charitable Trust (YCT), and Forum for Autism, against the use of stem cell therapy as a treatment.",

The basic principle behind Henshaw’s work was the notion that breathing in a pressurized environment could have positive effects on health. However, the understanding of the physiological effects of increased pressure and the therapeutic applications of hyperbaric environments was in its infancy then.\n\n1662: The concept of increased atmospheric pressure influencing the human body was first proposed by British clergyman and scientist Henshaw. He built a “Domicilium,” a sealed chamber, and suggested that it could be used to treat various medical conditions.\n1834: French surgeon Junod constructed a portable hyperbaric chamber and reported beneficial effects on patients with various conditions. The Bulletin of the Academy of Medicine reported Dr. Junod’s success with a complete recovery from a variety of medical conditions.\n1861: Paul Bert, a French physiologist, conducted comprehensive studies on the effects of increased atmospheric pressure and discovered the toxic effects of high-pressure oxygen that were manifested as seizures. He is known as the “father of hyperbaric physiology”\n1900s- Interest in oxygen therapy resurged when French doctors observed that patients undergoing hyperbaric-assisted surgery experienced fewer complications. Dr. John S. Haldane played an important role in advancing this field by studying the effects of compressed oxygen and subsequently developing dive tables for the Royal Navy. He came to be known as “Father of Oxygen Therapy.”\n1928- Dr.Cunningham discovered that there is a difference in mortality rate between flu patients living in higher elevations compared to patients living at lower elevations. In higher elevations, one breathes in less oxygen. He built a 5 storey chamber that offered more than 60 rooms designed to treat flu patients. In addition, Harvard Medical School built its first hyperbaric chamber,\n1937-1942: The U.S. military used hyperbaric oxygen to treat deep-sea divers with decompression sickness, also known as the bends.\n1955- Churchill-Davidson applied HBO to potentiate the effects of radiation therapy in cancer patients, while at the same time Boerema developed HBO as an adjunct to cardiac surgery, thus prolonging the time for circulatory arrest\n1956: The U.S. Navy established the first hyperbaric research program to explore various therapeutic applications.\n1960s: Hyperbaric oxygen therapy gained recognition for treating conditions such as carbon monoxide poisoning, crush injuries, and non-healing wounds.\n1970s: Hyperbaric chambers became more widely available, and research expanded to explore the therapy’s potential in treating other conditions, including chronic non-healing wounds and certain infections.\n1980s: The Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society (UHMS) was founded to promote research, education, and standards of practice in the field of hyperbaric medicine.\n1990s: Hyperbaric oxygen therapy gained popularity in treating chronic wounds, radiation injuries, and other conditions. However, there was controversy and debate about its efficacy in some applications.\n2000s: Research continued to explore the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for various neurological conditions, including traumatic brain injuries and certain neurodevelopmental disorders.\nPresent: Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is used as a standard treatment for conditions such as decompression sickness, chronic non-healing wounds, and certain infections. Ongoing research is exploring its potential applications in areas such as neurology, sports medicine, and chronic diseases.",

It is still experimental and no regulatory body approves using HBOT as a treatment for autism. It was seen a as a potential treatment for autism due to:\n\nAnti-Inflammatory Effects: Some studies have proposed that inflammation might play a role in the development of certain cases of autism causing communication issues and behaviors. HBOT, having its anti-inflammatory properties, is believed by some to potentially reduce inflammation in the brain, contributing to improvements in symptoms.\nOxygenation and Neural Function: The therapy involves exposing individuals to increased levels of oxygen, which may enhance oxygenation of tissues, including the brain. This increased oxygen availability is thought to support neural function and promote overall brain health.\nNeuroprotection and Tissue Repair: HBOT is known for its role in promoting tissue repair and regeneration. Proponents of HBOT for autism suggest that the therapy might have neuroprotective effects and contribute to the repair of neural circuits, potentially improving certain aspects of neurological function in individuals with autism.\nBlood Flow and Oxygen Delivery: The increased atmospheric pressure in the hyperbaric chamber enhances the solubility of oxygen in the blood, leading to higher oxygen concentrations in tissues. This is believed to improve blood flow and oxygen delivery to areas of the brain that may be affected in individuals with autism.\nMitigation of Oxidative Stress: Oxidative stress, resulting from an imbalance between free radicals and antioxidants, has been implicated in some cases of autism. HBOT proponents believe that HBOT may have antioxidant effects, potentially mitigating oxidative stress and its impact on the brain.\n\nSimilar to other alternative treatments, hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is categorized as an alternative treatment due to insufficient data, lack of conclusive evidence regarding its efficacy and impact. Comprehensive and definitive research is required before considering HBOT as a treatment for autism. Presently, studies suggesting its efficacy in treating autism are still experimental, and no definitive claims have been established.

Like any treatment, HBOT has associated side effects. Combined with the absence of conclusive evidence regarding its positive effects for autism, it is crucial to approach such treatments with caution and make informed decisions. Some reasons to exercise caution include:\n\nLack of Definitive Evidence: Scientific evidence supporting the efficacy of HBOT for autism is limited and inconclusive. The absence of well-designed, large-scale clinical trials makes it challenging to firmly establish the safety and effectiveness of HBOT for autism.\nHeterogeneity of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD): Autism is a heterogeneous condition with a wide range of symptoms and underlying factors. Responses to HBOT can vary among individuals with ASD, making it difficult to predict outcomes or adopt a one-size-fits-all approach.\nRisk of Adverse Effects: While generally considered safe, HBOT is not without risks. Adverse effects, such as ear barotrauma and sinus discomfort, can occur. The potential long-term effects of prolonged or repeated HBOT sessions for individuals with autism are not well understood.\nMedical procedure and Financial Costs: HBOT requires a lot of sessions and can be expensive. It may also not be covered by health insurance for the treatment of autism due to its experimental nature. Families should carefully assess the financial implications and weigh potential benefits against costs.\nEthical Considerations: Offering HBOT for autism without conclusive evidence of efficacy raises ethical concerns. Families should be cautious about therapies making bold claims without robust scientific support.\nUnregulated Clinics and Non-Medical Settings: Some facilities offer HBOT for autism outside rigorous clinical trials, and standards of care may vary. Treatment in reputable healthcare institutions with experienced professionals ensures safety and monitoring.\n\nIn summary, caution is advised when considering HBOT for autism. Thoroughly understanding the current scientific evidence, potential risks, and the experimental nature of the treatment is essential. Consulting with healthcare professionals and participating in well-designed clinical trials, when available, can offer more guidance on the appropriateness of HBOT for individual cases.",

    "text": "Diet - Autism Connection\nThe concept of diets impacting various autistic symptoms is rooted in the understanding of the gut-brain connection. The physical and biochemical connection between these two organs involves several mechanisms:\n\nVagus Nerve: The vagus nerve, one of the largest nerves in the body, establishes a strong connection between the gut and the brain. It facilitates the bidirectional transmission of signals.\nNeurotransmitters: Chemical messengers known as neurotransmitters play a crucial role in connecting the gut and the brain. These neurotransmitters, which regulate emotions and feelings, are produced in the brain. For instance, serotonin, a neurotransmitter associated with happiness and circadian rhythm control, is produced in both the brain and the gut. Additionally, gut microbes contribute to the production of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a neurotransmitter that helps manage feelings of fear and anxiety.\nGut Microbes: The trillions of microbes residing in the gut are integral to this connection. They produce various chemicals, including short-chain fatty acids that can reduce appetite and contribute to the formation of the blood-brain barrier. Moreover, these microbes play a role in immune system functioning, impacting inflammation. An overactive immune system can lead to inflammation, which, in turn, affects brain health.\n\nIn summary, the physical and biochemical interactions between the gut and brain involve the vagus nerve, neurotransmitters, and the activities of gut microbes. These connections influence emotional well-being, immune responses, and inflammation, contributing to the overall health of both the gut and the brain.",

    "text": "History of diet as therapy\nThe use of diets as a treatment for various medical conditions has a long and diverse history, and different diets have been proposed and implemented for therapeutic purposes.\n\nAncient Civilizations: Ancient cultures recognized the influence of diet on health. Hippocrates, often referred to as the “Father of Medicine” in ancient Greece, emphasized the significance of diet in maintaining health and preventing disease.\nFasting in Ancient Religions: Fasting has been a practice in many ancient religions for spiritual and health-related reasons. It is believed to purify the body and mind.\nDiet in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and Ayurveda: Traditional Chinese Medicine and the traditional system of medicine in India, Ayurveda, incorporate dietary principles as essential components of holistic healthcare. These systems emphasize balancing energies within the body through proper nutrition.\nDiet in the Middle Ages: In medieval Europe, dietary practices were often influenced by religious beliefs. Fasting and abstaining from certain foods were common practices in the belief of purifying the body from toxins.\nVitamin Deficiency Diseases: In the 18th and 19th centuries, the recognition of deficiency diseases, such as scurvy (vitamin C deficiency) and rickets (vitamin D deficiency), led to the understanding of the role of specific nutrients in preventing and treating illnesses.\nDiets for Epilepsy: The ketogenic diet, a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet, was introduced in the 1920s as a treatment for epilepsy. It fell out of favor with the advent of antiepileptic drugs but experienced a resurgence in the late 20th century.\nDietary Approaches for Specific Conditions: Over the years, various diets have been proposed and explored for specific health conditions. For example, the low-sodium DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet for managing hypertension and the Mediterranean diet for heart health gained recognition.\nDevelopment of Therapeutic Diets: Therapeutic diets, designed to manage specific health conditions, have been developed. These include the gluten-free diet for celiac disease, the low-FODMAP diet for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and the low-phenylalanine diet for phenylketonuria (PKU).\nEmergence of Dietary Therapies for Neurodevelopmental Disorders: In recent years, specific dietary interventions, like the gluten-free, casein-free (GFCF) diet, have been investigated for conditions such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Dr. Karl Reichelt proposed a hypothesis in 1991, suggesting that the consumption of gluten and casein by individuals with celiac disease might contribute to autism, particularly in those predisposed to the condition. According to this theory, these proteins, in the presence of a “leaky gut,” could be absorbed, leading to the creation of peptides with opioid-like effects. These peptides, in turn, were theorized to mimic or induce autism. This hypothesis led to the development of the Gluten-Free and Casein-Free diet (GFCF), sparking considerable controversy.\nCurrent Trends: Today, there is growing interest in the role of diet in overall health and disease prevention. Diets like the ketogenic diet, paleolithic diet, and plant-based diets are popular, and research continues to explore their potential benefits.\n\nIt’s important to note that while dietary interventions can play a role in managing certain health conditions, the effectiveness of specific diets varies, and not all dietary approaches have robust scientific support. Individuals considering dietary changes for therapeutic purposes should consult with respective healthcare professionals to ensure that nutritional needs are met and that the chosen diet is appropriate for their specific health condition. It also helps to do some self-study from reliable resources to see if a specific dietary approach will be feasible for the autistic individual and the family.",

    "text": "Types of diets for autism\nIn the light of gut brain connection, many diets have been suggested and tried as a treatment for various disorders including autistic symptoms. Diverse dietary interventions have been proposed for individuals with autism, yet it’s crucial to note that the scientific evidence supporting the efficacy of these diets is often limited and varied. Here are some diet types suggested for autism:\n\nGluten-Free, Casein-Free (GFCF) Diet: This involves removing gluten (found in wheat, barley, and rye) and casein (found in dairy) from the individual’s diet. Advocates claim potential improvements in behavior and social interactions. This is the most researched and commonly suggested intervention.\nSpecific Carbohydrate Diet (SCD): A restrictive diet eliminating complex carbohydrates, disaccharides, and polysaccharides. It permits specific easily digestible carbohydrates, aiming to positively impact gut health and alleviate autism-related symptoms.\nKetogenic Diet: A high-fat, low-carb diet used for epilepsy. Some reports suggest potential positive effects on behavior and cognitive function in individuals with autism. It has been suggested that epilepsy drives the development for ASD.\nLow-Oxalate Diet: Restricts foods high in oxalates, compounds found in some fruits, veggies, and nuts. Advocates claim it may alleviate sensory processing and gut-related symptoms in autism.\nLow-FODMAP Diet: Designed to reduce fermentable carbohydrates, potentially beneficial for individuals with autism and gastrointestinal issues, though more research is needed.\nOmega-3 Fatty Acid Supplementation: While not a specific diet, some individuals with autism are recommended omega-3 supplements for potential benefits in cognitive function and behavior.\n\nApproaching these dietary interventions cautiously is crucial, given the often inconclusive evidence regarding their effectiveness for autism. Individual responses can vary, and restrictive diets may pose challenges in meeting nutritional needs.",

    "text": "Caution\nIt’s essential to clearly understand why a dietary approach is chosen to manage autism symptoms and carefully assess associated costs. The relationship between autism and diet is an ongoing area of study, with existing research often lacking robust methodology, relying on anecdotal reports or personal experiences. The mechanism underlying the effectiveness of a diet for autism remains an unresolved research question, primarily based on the assumption that individuals with autism having an imbalanced gut microbiota contribute to their autism symptoms. Considering autism’s multifactorial nature, there is no evidence that only an imbalanced gut causes autism. Accepting an intervention solely based on authority or convenience should be avoided, especially if it compromises the health of the individual with autism. Each diet comes with its own benefits and costs. The side effects or consequences of following these diets can vary, and individual responses may differ. Here are some considerations:\n\nNutritional Deficiencies: Restrictive diets, especially those that eliminate entire food groups, may increase the risk of nutritional deficiencies. For example, the GFCF diet excludes wheat and dairy, which are sources of essential nutrients like calcium, vitamin D, and fiber. Studies have reported low bone mineral densities among individuals with autism who have excluded dairy from their diets. It’s important to ensure that nutritional needs are met through alternative food sources or supplements.\nFurther Gastrointestinal Distress: Dietary changes, particularly those involving the removal of certain foods, can sometimes lead to gastrointestinal distress. This may include changes in bowel habits, constipation, or diarrhea. It’s crucial to monitor and address any digestive issues that may arise.\nSocial and Practical Challenges: Following a specialized diet can present social and practical challenges. Individuals with autism may already have preferences or sensitivities to certain textures or flavors, and imposing further dietary restrictions may affect their willingness to eat or participate in social activities.\nEmotional Impact: Dietary interventions can have emotional implications, particularly for children or individuals who may find it challenging to adapt to changes in their eating habits. It’s important to consider the emotional well-being of individuals with autism when implementing dietary changes.\nFinancial Costs: Some specialized diets may involve increased costs due to the need for specific ingredients, supplements, or alternative food products. Studies suggest that gluten free products are a certain percentage more expensive than products with gluten and casein. Considering the longeveity of intervention, it would be a sustained expense. Families should be aware of the financial implications and plan accordingly.\nUnsubstantiated Claims and Lack of Evidence: Many of the suggested diets for autism are based on anecdotal evidence rather than robust scientific research. Following a diet without sufficient evidence of its effectiveness may lead to disappointment and frustration if the expected benefits are not realized.\nPotential for Nutritional Excess: In some cases, the emphasis on certain food groups or supplements in an attempt to address specific symptoms may lead to an imbalance and excess intake of certain nutrients. This can have its own set of health implications.\n\nConsulting healthcare professionals, including accredited dietitians and specialists in autism, and thoroughly assessing the feasibility of the chosen approach in the context of the child’s health and family circumstances is essential to ensure that the selected diet is safe and suitable for overall well-being. It is reiterated that there is no definitive evidence supporting the sole effectiveness of a diet for managing autism. In most studies, the change in behaviors post diet are reports from parents and there has been no objective measurement of the same.",

    "text": "History of homeopathy\nHomeopathy was founded by Samuel Hahnemann (1755-1843), who obtained his medical degree in Erlangen in 1779. Despite struggling financially during his initial years as a physician, Hahnemann made a significant discovery that would shape his future. In an experiment, he began taking regular doses of cinchona, also known as ‘the bark’ or quinine. Remarkably, he experienced symptoms similar to those of intermittent fever (malaria) but in a milder form and without the characteristic rigors of the disease. This observation sparked a groundbreaking idea.\nIn 1796, Hahnemann published his findings in “Essay on a New Principle for Ascertaining the Curative Power of Drugs.” This was followed by his influential work, “The Organon of the Healing Art,” in 1810. These works laid out the fundamental principles of homeopathy, including the “law of similars” and the process of potentization, shaping the foundation of this alternative medical system. Despite initial financial struggles, Hahnemann’s contributions to homeopathy gained recognition and had a lasting impact on the field of alternative medicine. Here is a timeline of how homeopathy progressed:\n\n1796: Dissatisfied with the medical practices of his time, Samuel Hahnemann began experimenting with the use of substances to treat various illnesses. He first describes the Law of Similars (“Like cures like”). This principle suggests that a substance that can cause symptoms in a healthy person can be used to treat similar symptoms in a sick person.\nLate 18th Century: Hahnemann conducted a series of experiments on himself and others, ingesting small doses of substances to observe their effects. He systematically recorded the symptoms produced and proposed the use of highly diluted doses of substances to treat similar symptoms in patients.\n1810: Hahnemann published his foundational work, “Organon of the Healing Art,” outlining the principles and practices of homeopathy. The text underwent several editions, with the final edition, the sixth, published posthumously in 1921.\n1830s: Homeopathic schools and hospitals begin to open in the United States and Europe.\n1838: Repertory to the More Characteristic Symptoms of Materia Medica, a homeopathic reference, first appears in English.\n1842: Oliver Wendel Holmes Sr.—physician, critic of homeopathy and father of a Supreme Court justice—publishes the scathing “Homeopathy and Its Kindred Delusions.”\n1847: The American Medical Association is founded, offering a decidedly unfavorable view of homeopathy. Homeopathy faced criticism and challenges, particularly from proponents of conventional medicine.\n1885: Hahnemann Hospital opens as a homeopathic facility in Philadelphia.\nMid-1900s: Homeopathic schools dwindle and disappear. Hahnemann Hospital is sold to new owners, who switch to allopathic medicine but retain a homeopathic library and some elective courses. The Flexner Report in the early 20th century, which led to the reform of medical education in the United States, marginalized homeopathy in favor of allopathic medicine.\n1972: The Center for Education and Development of Clinical Homeopathy was founded with the goal of teaching practical, pragmatic homeopathy at campuses across the country, including one in Philadelphia. In the latter half of the 20th century, there was a resurgence of interest in alternative and complementary medicine, including homeopathy. Some individuals sought out homeopathic treatments as an alternative or complementary approach to conventional medicine.\nCurrent Status: Homeopathy is practiced in various parts of the world, and homeopathic remedies are available over the counter in many countries. However, its acceptance within the mainstream medical community varies, with skepticism regarding its scientific basis and efficacy. Homeopathy continues to be a subject of debate and controversy within the scientific and medical communities. Research on the efficacy of homeopathic treatments has yielded mixed results, and debates persist on issues such as the mechanisms of action and the significance of highly diluted substances.",

    "text": "Why homeopathy for autism?\nThe multifaceted nature of autism has led to the exploration of various “cures” for the condition. The application of homeopathy to autism lacks a clear rationale. Considering homeopathy is often considered an alternative medicine, it is applied broadly across different conditions. The decision to try homeopathy for autism might stem from a dissatisfaction with the gradual outcomes of evidence-based management and a natural inclination to explore every possible way for improvement.\nAdvocates assert that homeopathy enhances behavioral symptoms associated with autism, including aggressiveness, sensory processing issues, language, speech, and communication. However, these claims rely solely on anecdotal evidence. There is a notable absence of valid scientific evidence explaining the mechanisms by which homeopathy works for some individuals and not for others. The lack of a robust scientific foundation raises questions about the reliability and generalizability of reported improvements associated with homeopathic treatments for autism.\nCertain homeopathic practitioners argue against the use of randomized controlled trials, stating that patient satisfaction should be the sole criterion for judging the effectiveness of homeopathy. However, when clinical trials and systematic reviews have been conducted, the outcomes remain uncertain. While a few studies suggested slight effectiveness, a majority indicated that homeopathy had no therapeutic effect. It’s important to note that many trials included in systematic reviews were deemed imperfect in terms of design, application, or sample size. This highlights the challenges in establishing conclusive evidence regarding the efficacy of homeopathy through rigorous scientific methods.",

The process involves the following steps:\n\nInitial consultation: A comprehensive discussion with the individual with autism or their caregivers to collect information on medical history, behavioral symptoms, sensory sensitivities, and emotional well-being.\nIndividualized assessment: A focus on understanding the unique expression of symptoms in each person, including their overall constitution, temperament, and responses to various stimuli.\nChoosing the homeopathic remedy: Choosing a homeopathic remedy that aligns with the individual’s symptoms and constitutional characteristics. These remedies are often highly diluted substances derived from plants, minerals, or animals.\nPotentization: Subjecting the chosen remedy to potentization, involving dilution and succussion (vigorous shaking) to enhance therapeutic properties while minimizing potential toxic effects. Administration of the remedy: Providing the homeopathic remedy in a highly diluted form, typically as small sugar pellets or liquid drops. The dosage and frequency are determined by the homeopath’s recommendations.\nFollow-Up consultations: Regular follow-up sessions to evaluate the individual’s response to the remedy and make any necessary adjustments to the treatment plan. These consultations help monitor changes in symptoms and emotional well-being.\nMonitoring progress: Continuously assessing the person’s progress, considering changes in behavioral symptoms, sensory sensitivities, and communication skills relevant to autism.

    "text": "Caution\nCaution should be exercised when contemplating homeopathy as a treatment for autism, given several compelling reasons, despite its popularity in certain alternative medicine circles. Here are key factors contributing to the need for caution:\n\nLack of Scientific Evidence: The foundational principles of homeopathy, such as the law of similars and the use of highly diluted substances, lack robust scientific backing. Studies on homeopathic treatments for autism are often limited, with small-scale research producing mixed and inconclusive results.\nPlacebo Effect: Perceived benefits from homeopathic treatments may be influenced by the placebo effect, where improvements result from the belief in treatment efficacy rather than the treatment itself. This can lead to subjective reports of improvement that may not be objectively measurable.\nIndividual Variability in Responses: Responses to homeopathic treatments vary widely among individuals, making it challenging to predict outcomes. This variability is compounded by the diverse nature of autism symptoms, complicating the assessment of treatment efficacy.\nRisk of Delaying or Avoiding Evidence-Based Interventions: Relying solely on homeopathy may lead to delays in accessing evidence-based interventions with demonstrated efficacy. Established components of effective autism management, such as early and intensive behavioral interventions, may be postponed.\nFinancial Costs: Homeopathic treatments, like other alternative therapies, may incur financial costs. Families should consider the potential financial burden, especially when these treatments lack robust scientific support.\nPotential for Harm: While homeopathic remedies are generally considered safe due to their highly diluted nature, harm may occur if individuals forego proven medical treatments in favor of homeopathy. Prioritizing interventions with a solid scientific basis is crucial.\nUnregulated Nature of Homeopathic Products: Homeopathic products may not undergo the same regulatory scrutiny as conventional medications. Variability in quality control and manufacturing consistency raises concerns about the reliability and safety of these products.\nEthical Considerations: The use of homeopathy for autism raises ethical considerations, especially when individuals or families are led to believe in the efficacy of a treatment lacking strong scientific support. Providing accurate and transparent information about the evidence base for any therapeutic approach is essential.\n\nIn summary, exercising caution is important when considering homeopathy for autism, considering the lack of scientific validation, the potential for the placebo effect, individual variability, the risk of delaying evidence-based interventions, financial costs, the potential for harm, and the unregulated nature of homeopathic products. Prioritizing evidence-based interventions and consulting with healthcare professionals ensures informed decisions regarding the management of autism spectrum disorder.",

    "text": "Ayurveda and Autism\nThe idea of using Ayurveda for autism is a relatively recent development and is part of the broader interest in alternative and complementary therapies for managing various health conditions. Ayurveda, as an ancient system of medicine, has a long history, but its application to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) gained attention in the latter part of the 20th century and the early 21st century. There is limited scientific evidence supporting the efficacy of Ayurveda in improving autism symptoms. Ayurveda, a traditional system of medicine, encompasses a holistic approach to health and well-being. While some proponents suggest that Ayurvedic practices may offer benefits for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), it’s crucial to note that research in this area is limited. The scientific community remains cautious about making definitive claims regarding the effectiveness of Ayurveda for autism. Some individuals and families may explore Ayurveda as a complementary or alternative therapy for autism based on the following principles:\n\nHolistic Approach: Ayurveda takes a holistic approach, considering the interconnectedness of the mind, body, and spirit. The belief is that balancing these aspects can contribute to overall health and well-being.\nIndividualized Treatment: Ayurvedic treatments are often individualized based on a person’s unique constitution or dosha. The idea is that addressing specific imbalances in an individual’s constitution may promote health and alleviate symptoms.\nDietary and Lifestyle Recommendations: Ayurveda places significant emphasis on dietary and lifestyle practices. Recommendations may include specific dietary modifications, the use of herbal remedies, and the incorporation of practices such as meditation, yoga, and breathing exercises.\nStress Reduction: Stress reduction is considered essential in Ayurveda for maintaining balance and preventing disease. Practices that promote relaxation and reduce stress, such as meditation and yoga, may be recommended.\nHerbal Remedies: Ayurveda incorporates the use of herbal remedies, derived from plants and natural substances. Some herbal formulations in Ayurveda are believed to have properties that may support cognitive function and address symptoms associated with neurological conditions.\n\nIt’s crucial to highlight the need for rigorous scientific research to establish the safety and effectiveness of Ayurveda in the context of autism. While anecdotal reports and individual testimonials may suggest positive outcomes, these do not substitute for well-designed clinical trials with large sample sizes and rigorous methodologies.\nIf individuals or families are considering Ayurveda for autism, it is strongly advised to consult with healthcare professionals, particularly those with expertise in autism. Integrating Ayurveda into an overall care plan in collaboration with conventional evidence-based interventions is essential. Open communication with healthcare providers ensures that any therapeutic approach aligns with the best interests and well-being of individuals with autism.",

    "text": "History of Ayurveda\nThe history of Ayurveda is deeply rooted in ancient Indian civilization, and its principles have been passed down through oral traditions and written texts. Its foundations are deeply rooted in the ancient schools of Hindu Philosophical teachings, specifically the Vaisheshika school and the school of logic known as Nyaya. Additionally, Ayurveda is closely connected to the manifestation framework, commonly recognized as Samkhya. It emerged during the same period when the schools of Nyaya and Vaisheshika were flourishing. Ayurveda is also said to have a divine origin, believed to come from the Hindu God Brahma, who is considered the creator of the universe. Before the establishment of philosophical schools, this holistic knowledge of healing was passed from Brahma to sages, who then shared it with their disciples and the general population through writings and spoken stories. They described the healing properties of herbs in poetic verses called “Shlokas.”\nAyurveda’s foundation lies in four important collections of knowledge called Vedas. The Rig Veda, the most famous among them, talks about 67 plants and 1028 Shlokas. The Atharva Veda and Yajur Veda mention 293 and 81 plants with medicinal uses, respectively. Ayurveda’s practice is deeply rooted in the insights gained from these ancient Vedas. Following is an overview of the history of Ayurveda:\n\nVedic Period (1500 BCE - 600 BCE): The earliest roots of Ayurveda can be traced back to the Vedic period in ancient India. The knowledge of Ayurveda is believed to be part of the Vedas, the oldest sacred texts of Hinduism. The Rigveda, one of the Vedic texts, contains hymns related to healing and the use of medicinal plants.\nCompilation of Ayurvedic Texts (600 BCE - 200 CE): The foundational texts of Ayurveda, known as the “Samhitas,” were compiled during this period. The most significant among them are the Charaka Samhita, attributed to the sage Charaka (physician), and the Sushruta Samhita, attributed to the sage Sushruta (surgeon). These texts cover various aspects of health, disease, diagnosis, treatment, and surgical procedures.\nGolden Age of Ayurveda (200 CE - 1200 CE): During this period, Ayurveda flourished and became more organized. The works of influential scholars such as Vagbhata contributed to the development and systematization of Ayurvedic knowledge. The Ashtanga Hridaya, written by Vagbhata, is an important compendium that synthesized earlier Ayurvedic teachings.\nIslamic Influence (1200 CE - 1800 CE): With the advent of Islamic rule in India, Ayurveda faced challenges but continued to evolve. Some Ayurvedic texts were translated into Arabic, and Unani medicine, influenced by Ayurveda, emerged as a distinct medical tradition.\nColonial Period (17th Century Onward): The colonial period saw the arrival of European powers in India. The British East India Company established control, and Ayurveda faced challenges during this period. The British colonial authorities initially viewed Ayurveda with skepticism.\nRevival Efforts (Late 19th Century - 20th Century): The late 19th and early 20th centuries witnessed efforts to revive and institutionalize Ayurveda. Key figures such as Swami Dayananda Saraswati and Mahatma Gandhi emphasized the importance of traditional Indian systems of medicine, including Ayurveda.\nPost-Independence Era (1947 Onward): After India gained independence in 1947, there were renewed efforts to promote and modernize Ayurveda. The establishment of institutions, research centers, and government initiatives aimed at preserving and promoting Ayurvedic knowledge.\nGlobal Recognition and Integration (Late 20th Century Onward): In recent decades, there has been a growing global interest in Ayurveda. It has gained recognition as an alternative and complementary system of medicine worldwide. Ayurvedic practices, including herbal remedies, dietary recommendations, and lifestyle interventions, have found a place in integrative medicine approaches.\n\nToday, Ayurveda continues to be practiced in India and other parts of the world. It has influenced various alternative and complementary medicine practices and is recognized for its holistic approach to health and well-being. Despite its rich history, it’s important to note that scientific validation and standardization of Ayurvedic practices remain ongoing challenges.",

    "text": "Caution\nWhile some individuals and families may consider exploring Ayurveda as a complementary or alternative therapy for autism, it’s important to approach it with caution and consider several factors. Here are some key points to keep in mind when seeking Ayurveda for autism:\n\nLimited Scientific Evidence: There is limited scientific evidence supporting the efficacy of Ayurveda specifically for autism. Rigorous research, including well-designed clinical trials, is needed to establish its safety and effectiveness.\nIndividual Variability in Responses: Responses to Ayurvedic treatments can vary among individuals. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex and heterogeneous condition, and what works for one person may not work for another. Factors such as the severity of symptoms and overall health can influence individual responses.\nIntegration with Conventional Care: Ayurvedic approaches should be viewed as complementary rather than a substitute for evidence-based interventions recommended by healthcare providers. It’s important to communicate openly with healthcare professionals, including those with expertise in autism, to ensure that Ayurveda is integrated into an overall care plan.\nSafety Considerations: While Ayurveda is generally considered safe when practiced by trained practitioners, it’s crucial to ensure that any herbal remedies or dietary recommendations align with the individual’s overall health. Consult with healthcare professionals, especially if the individual is on any medications or has pre-existing health conditions.\nConsultation with Qualified Practitioners: Seek Ayurvedic treatments from qualified practitioners who have training and experience in Ayurveda. Professional Ayurvedic practitioners may have certifications or qualifications from recognized institutions. Verify their credentials before starting any treatment.\nTransparency and Informed Consent: Practitioners should be transparent about the nature of Ayurvedic treatments, potential benefits, and possible risks. Informed consent is essential, and individuals or caregivers should be fully informed about what to expect from Ayurvedic interventions.\nMonitoring Progress: Regularly monitor the individual’s progress and communicate with healthcare providers. If any concerns or unexpected changes arise, it’s important to discuss them with both Ayurvedic practitioners and conventional healthcare professionals.\nFinancial Considerations: Consider the financial implications of Ayurvedic treatments, as some interventions may involve costs. Be aware of any potential financial burden and ensure that the chosen approach aligns with the overall budget for healthcare.\nCultural Sensitivity: Ayurveda is deeply rooted in Indian culture, and cultural sensitivity is important. Ensure that practitioners understand and respect the cultural context and preferences of the individuals and families seeking Ayurvedic care.\nOngoing Communication: Establish open and ongoing communication between Ayurvedic practitioners and other healthcare providers involved in the individual’s care. Collaboration can contribute to a more comprehensive and integrated approach.\n\nIt’s important to recognize that individual experiences with Ayurveda may vary, and what works for one person may not work for another. For individuals or families considering Ayurveda for autism, consulting healthcare professionals, especially those knowledgeable about autism, is strongly advised. Integrating Ayurveda into an overall care plan should be a collaborative effort with healthcare providers familiar with both Ayurvedic principles and conventional evidence-based approaches to autism. Open communication ensures that any therapeutic approach aligns with the best interests and well-being of individuals with autism.",

    "section": "What is disability?",
    "text": "What is disability?\nAs people who are dealing with or working with disabilities, we naturally want to learn more about specific disabilities, be it autism, vision impairment, hearing impairment etc. However, it may make sense to step back to try and understand the concept of disability.\nThere has been much social and political discourse around the concept of disability in the last few decades. The discourse includes questions like what does ‘disability’ mean and what does it identify, what are its causes and consequences, and what should be an appropriate response to disability at an individual and societal level.\nMuch of this debate has focused on removing or reforming the conventional social definitions and attitudes that have defined disability in terms of pathology or a deficit. Such ‘deficit approach’ to disability, based on medical models of impairments with hard notions of pathology, has led to responses that invoke charity and pity at best. More commonly, such approaches have led to stigma, exclusion or marginalisation of persons identified as disabled.\nThe response to this has been to move away from the medical models and to take views that consider disability to be wholly socially constructed and the result primarily of social stigma and discrimination. Many activists reject the concept of disability itself as unhelpful, and advocate terms that remove any implication of essential differences that the relevant groups are supposed to carry.\nIn this note, and throughout the accompanying resources, we see a balance between these two views. We do not reject the use of disability as a descriptor. For example, we will not reject the use of “Dyslexic” as a descriptor just because it comes from a medical model of the deficiency referring to the inability to read words. However, we do not believe the differences in human abilities themselves define disability. Most of these human abilities lie along a spectrum and it is impossible to identify or assign disability without reference to context and environmental conditions. For example, someone with dyslexia would be more disabled as a newspaper editor and not as disabled as a crane operator. It may be important to emphasize here that we do not use the words ‘disability’ and ‘disabled’ as medical terms.\nHuman beings have psycho-social abilities and characteristics that lie along a spectrum. Any atypicality or differences in these individual abilities may diminish the personal and social functioning of the individual. This may be worsened by the social conditions, including the built environment, the structure of opportunities that society presents to various groups or the attitudes, feelings, and actions the individual confronts in the people around.\nWhen seen this way, ‘disability’ is a status descriptor that attaches to a person and\n\nIdentifies that there are limitations in the person’s functioning in the world\nlocates the limitations in the interaction between the person’s physical or psychological characteristics and the social environment\nacknowledges that it may actually or potentially diminish the person’s wellbeing.\n\n\nSocial and policy responses\nThe Indvidual identified as disabled, or their immediate caregivers might initiate their own responses to adapt to the challenges arising out of the disability. In addition, disability calls for moral responses that include the duty of care and concern that is expected both out of the primary caregivers and the society at large, including policy responses. The notion of care is not meant as a response of pity or compassion. It is the idea of an ethic of care that is part of a broader set of moral considerations, including respect, responsibility, inclusion, and justice.\nThus, our understanding of disability is an affirmative model in the sense that disability is not automatically assumed to be socially crippling. Similarly, the responses to disability are also assumed to be within the range of diversity that can be accepted, responded to and managed by the society. On the other hand, we do not adopt a view that all disability is necessarily socially constructed, which places the onus of response entirely on social values and systems.\nIn summary, the broad set of value orientations that we adopt for designing responses include:\n\nEvery person who is suspected to be atypical in their repertoire of capacities should have, if they so wish, access to expert assistance in the evaluation and identification of characteristics that might amount to a disability. This is especially important in the case of marginalised and socio-economically disadvantaged communities.\nOnce identified, the person and their primary caregivers must have access to advice and support to help understand how the disability might influence or limit the person’s functioning unless actively addressed. In this, we adopt a bio-psycho-social approach to the analysis of disability.\nThe person must have access to the best expertise that society can currently offer, to ameliorate the impact of the underlying condition that constitutes the disability. Depending on the nature of the disability, responses may range from medical attention to correctable conditions to psychotherapy and at the other end, social and policy accommodations that reduce or eliminate the limitations imposed by the context.\n\nThis view adopts values that do not see disability as natural disadvantage. Disadvantages are largely constituted by social responses. A social orientation that values respect, inclusion, responsibility, and justice will expand the range of disability that can be easily accommodated within normal social life.\nThis view also acknowledges that prejudice and ignorance may make social structures and processes less inclusive of disabilities. So systematic attempts to remove stigma and gaps in knowledge that prevent inclusion is a necessary component of possible responses. A long and sustained programme of advocacy that tackles systemic exclusion and leads to more conducive social policy environment is equally important."

    "section": "Models of Disability",
    "text": "Models of Disability\nWith this understanding of disability, we can see that it puts people living with disabilities on the same equal platform as everyone else, as it should. We can now look at the various aspects of living with disability that we need to account for.\nDo we often see disabilities as deficits to be filled, or diseases that need to be cured? And therefore, do we believe that if we take care of the deficit, then the person will be “normal” and “alright”? Let us say one is visually impaired and is unable to see, and therefore faces certain difficulties. Do we believe that they need to find ways to overcome the specific disabilities that come from their inability to see, and with that, the person will be fine? Or say, if someone has a motor impairment, do we give them a wheelchair or any other way of making sure they can move freely, and that is the solution to it?\nThis is one way of looking at disability, as a deficit, as the absence of something they are supposed to have but do not, so let us bridge the gap. This is the biomedical approach, that sees disability as arising primarily from biology, and relies on medical approaches to address the biological difficulties.\nHowever, this way of looking at it may not present the complete picture. If a person is unable to move around, the biological difficulty needs to be addressed, but how are the others looking at them? Therefore, how does it make them feel? How does this influence how they see themselves? Then again, is the world around them designed to accommodate their difficulty? Or does it amplify their difficulties?\nWhen we start thinking along these lines, it becomes easy to see that the biomedical model that looks primarily at the biology of the disability, and relies on medical approaches to address the deficits, falls short of dealing with the entirety of disability. This is where the idea of a bio-psycho-social model of disability comes into the picture.\nWe need to see disability not just as a product of the biological factors, but also the psychological and social factors. When we say factors, we mean that the biological difficulty or disability may be amplified by the social configurations and societal structure. For example, having ramps around enables a motor impaired person while not having them amplifies their difficulties. Having or not having ramps has nothing to do with the biology of a person, it is about the societal structures around them. Similarly, if a person who is hard of hearing is looked down upon or is thought of as being difficult to deal with, it has psychological and social impact on the person dealing with the disability, as well as the people around them.\nThis is what we mean when we say that a disability can be looked at from a broader lens, the bio-psycho-social lens. When we see the biological, as well as the psychological and social implications of it, we can see the range of factors that affect the person living with disability. It can then help us address disability and related issues in a more holistic manner."

    "section": "Responding to disability",
    "text": "Responding to disability\nLet us now look at what we need to keep in mind with respect to interventions for disability. Here, we use the word intervention to mean anything that improves the quality of life for people living with disabilities. Choosing to get a pair of glasses for a person who cannot see well is an intervention, getting a hearing implant for someone with hearing impairment is an intervention, speech therapy is an intervention. What should be the nature of these interventions? How can one choose between various options? Some of what we say here may sound like common sense, but it is important that we be clear about how we make our choices as disabled people, and their parents, teachers, therapists, and social workers.\nThe first thing that comes to mind is strengths-based approach. This starts with the presumption of competence - all individuals have the ability to communicate, to participate, to relate to others and to build a meaningful life for themselves, in their own ways. This approach allows us to see the person as a whole, who they truly are, and not limit ourselves to the condition they live with. It allows us to use the strengths of a person to enable their learning and growth.\nThe next thing is to see if the interventions are functional for the person. The disabled person is the actor, they are at the centre of the interventions and should have a say in which interventions are working and which are not. The interventions should add to the quality of life of the person with the disability and the people around them. For example, if we have a child with ADHD who runs around and we want him to learn to sit in one place, one must ask if sitting in one place is functional for them. Is it working for them? Does it add to the quality of their life or is the intervention meant to remove the discomfort of the people around? Similarly, people with autism tend to flap their hands as a way of self-regulation. Should we aim to stop it? We should constantly ask if the intervention is aimed at a functional goal for the person.\nAnother aspect to see is if the interventions are family centric and consider the community context. We need to recognise people with disabilities live in a social context, with their families, and embedded in the community. So, the interventions need to be something the family understands, approves of, and can execute. The person cannot be forever dependent on some professional who delivers interventions that cannot be handled by anyone else. Therefore, interventions should be designed considering the family circumstances and the social setting of the people with disabilities. For example, if we have a person from the rural community, the goals for that person and the interventions need to be situated in the community where they are growing up, living, and where they aspire to spend their life.\nWhen we think along these lines, interventions need to be strengths based - they presume competence and use the strengths of the person to make progress. They need to be functional - helpful in improving the quality of life of the person. They need to be situated in the context of the family and community - they account for who the person is, the family and the community they live in and what they aspire to do in that setting."

Despite the tremendous amount of work being done by both the government and non-government actors in the disability space in India, information about various aspects of disabilities is still out of the reach of many people who need it. In many cases, well known and credible sources of information are not India-specific. A lot of such information is not readily usable.\nDiversipedia is an attempt to provide India specific information related to the 21 disabilities listed in the Rights of PwD act, 2016. We aspire to provide readily usable information to all the stakeholders in the disability space, including Pwd, their caregivers, agencies working with them etc. Here, we cover the various aspects of disability, starting from perspectives on the meaning and implications of disability, to disability specific guides that provide specific information related issues across the lifecycle, to various governmental and non-governmental sources of support. Diversipedia also includes resources to learn more, provides a directory of service providers as well as forums where people can interact with each other.\nPlease get in touch with abcd@xyz to join this effort.

It’s worth noting that developmental screening can be conducted as a standard part of a child’s regular health checkup, even if there are no apparent concerns.The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends developmental and behavioral screening for all children during regular visits at the ages of 9 months 18 months and 30 months.\nIn addition, AAP recommends that all children be screened specifically for ASD during regular visits at 18 months and 24 months.",

Screening tool commonly used by clinical/ developmental psychologists and psychiatrists in India is\n\nM-CHAT-R/F (Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers, Revised with Follow-Up)\nThe Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers, Revised with Follow-Up (M-CHAT-R/F; Robins, Fein, & Barton, 2009) is a two-stage parent-report screening tool designed to assess the risk of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The M-CHAT-R/F is freely available for download for clinical, research, and educational purposes. Here are the usage instructions:\n\nThe M-CHAT-R can be utilized and scored during routine well-child care visits, and it is also suitable for specialists and other professionals to evaluate the risk of ASD.\nThe primary objective of the M-CHAT-R is to maximize sensitivity, meaning it aims to identify as many cases of ASD as possible. Consequently, there is a relatively high rate of false positives, indicating that not all children who score as at risk will be diagnosed with ASD.\nTo address this, the Follow-Up questions (M-CHAT-R/F) have been developed. Users should be aware that even with the Follow-Up questions, a significant number of children who screen positive on the M-CHAT-R will not receive an ASD diagnosis. However, it’s important to recognize that these children are at a heightened risk for other developmental disorders or delays, making it crucial to consider further evaluation for any child who screens positive.\n\n\n\nOccupational Therapy Evaluation\nAs an occupational therapist (OT), the evaluation of a child with autism involves a comprehensive assessment of various domains, including social, communication, cognitive, sensory, and motor skills. It is valuable to incorporate a sensory profile of the child and consider the results of assessments conducted by other professionals. The Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) assessment conducted by an occupational therapist can take place in diverse settings, such as at home, in school, or at one of our clinics.\nDuring the ASD assessment, the occupational therapist, using their clinical expertise and specialized training, employs a combination of a sensory profile, autism checklist and clinical observation. The checklist and sensory profile is designed to gather information on how the child perceives and interacts with the world. For example, it includes questions related to the child’s comfort level in social situations, their preference for solitary play versus engaging with others, and other factors that provide insights into their sensory experiences and responses. This multidimensional assessment approach helps tailor intervention strategies to meet the child’s specific needs and challenges.\n\n\nSpeech and Language Evaluation\nAs a Speech Language pathologist (SLP), one can conduct initial screenings to identify any communication and language delays or atypical behaviors that may be indicative of autism. SLPs can conduct comprehensive assessments to evaluate a child’s communication and language skills. This assessment may involve evaluating speech and language development, as well as social communication abilities.",

The formal diagnosis of autism is typically made by a medical professional, clinical psychologist, or developmental pediatrician based on a comprehensive evaluation that considers various factors, including communication and language development, social interactions, and repetitive behaviors.\n\nCARS - Childhood Rating Scale\nThe Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) has been updated as the CARS-2. The original CARS was a widely-used rating scale for autism, primarily designed for individuals with co-occurring intellectual functioning. However, it faced criticism for not accurately identifying higher-functioning individuals on the autism spectrum. The CARS-2 preserves the original CARS format for use with younger or lower-functioning individuals (now known as the CARS2-ST or “Standard Form”). Simultaneously, it introduces a distinct rating scale designed for higher-functioning individuals (referred to as the CARS2-HF or “High Functioning”).\nClinically, the original CARS was sometimes misused as a parent questionnaire, but it was originally intended as a clinician rating scale to be completed following direct observation of the child by a professional knowledgeable about autism, who had also received some brief training on how to assess the CARS items. The CARS-2 maintains this format. Parent input can be gathered using the CARS2-QPC (Questionnaire of Parent Concerns), a form that parents use to document their observations (although it is not scored).\nSpecific guidelines for usage include: + CARS2-ST can be employed with children under the age of 6, or over the age of 6 but with an estimated IQ of 79 or lower, or if there is a significant communication impairment. + CARS-HF is administered to children aged 6 or older, with an estimated IQ of 80 or higher, and who possess fluent communication skills.\n\n\nAutism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) - (ADOS; Lord, Rutter, DiLavore, Risi, 1999)\nThe Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) is considered the ‘gold standard’ for assessing and diagnosing autism and pervasive developmental disorder (PDD) in individuals of all ages, developmental stages, and language abilities. This semi-structured assessment is versatile and can be applied to evaluate individuals suspected of having autism, ranging from toddlers to adults, and encompassing those with a wide spectrum of language skills.\nThe ADOS comprises four distinct modules, each of which can be administered in a relatively short timeframe of 35 to 40 minutes. The module selected for assessment depends on the individual’s expressive language level and chronological age. Guided by the instructions in the manual, the appropriate module is chosen for each person. Module 1 is designed for children who do not consistently use phrase speech, Module 2 for those using phrase speech but not verbally fluent Module 3 for fluent children, and Module 4 for fluent adolescents and adults. It’s worth noting that the ADOS does not specifically address nonverbal adolescents and adults within the autism spectrum. During the ADOS assessment, there’s a 30- to 45-minute observation period that offers ample opportunities for a trained administrator to observe social and communication behaviors relevant to the diagnosis of pervasive developmental disorders. As the ADOS is conducted, observations are recorded and later coded to formulate a diagnosis. Cut-off scores are provided for both the broader diagnosis of PDD/atypical autism/autism spectrum and the more traditional, narrower concept of autism. By offering standardized materials and ratings, the ADOS provides an evaluation of autism spectrum disorders that remains independent of language capabilities.\n\n\nAutism Diagnostic Interview, Revised (ADI-R) - (ADI-R; Couteur, Lord, Rutter, 2003)\nThe Autism Diagnostic Interview, Revised (ADI-R) is a structured interview employed for the purpose of diagnosing autism, planning treatment strategies, and distinguishing autism from other developmental disorders. Having been used in research studies for many years, this comprehensive interview is an invaluable tool for conducting a thorough assessment of individuals suspected of having autism or related autism spectrum disorders. The administration and scoring of the ADI-R typically take between 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours.\nTo administer the ADI-R, a skilled clinical interviewer engages in a structured dialogue with a parent or caretaker who possesses in-depth knowledge of the developmental history and current behaviors of the individual being assessed. This interview can be utilized for assessing both children and adults, provided their mental age is above 2 years and 0 months.\nThe ADI-R consists of 93 items and focuses on three key functional domains: Language/Communication Reciprocal Social Interactions Restricted, Repetitive, and Stereotyped Behaviors and Interests\nFollowing highly standardized procedures, the interviewer records and codes the responses provided by the informant. The interview questions cover eight distinct content areas:\n\nThe subject’s background, including family, educational history, previous diagnoses, and medication use.\nAn overview of the subject’s behavior.\nEarly development and achievement of developmental milestones.\nLanguage acquisition and potential loss of language or other skills.\nCurrent functioning related to language and communication.\nSocial development and play.\nInterests and behaviors.\nClinically relevant behaviors, such as aggression, self-injury, and possible epileptic features.\n\nUnlike tests, the ADI-R is an interview process that focuses on behaviors that are uncommon in individuals not affected by autism. As a result, it yields specific results rather than relying on scales or norms. These results can be used to support a diagnosis of autism or to determine the clinical needs of various groups in which a high prevalence of autism spectrum disorders might be expected. This includes individuals with severe language impairments, certain medical conditions, congenital blindness, or those who have experienced institutional deprivation.\nHere is a comprehensive note on autism assessment, screening tools and communicating with parents.",

    "text": "Revealing the diagnosis to parents\nAbsolutely, revealing an autism diagnosis to parents is a crucial and sensitive step in the process. It’s essential for professionals to approach this conversation with empathy and provide guidance on the next steps. Here are some suggestions for professionals on how to convey the diagnosis and offer support to parents:\n\nChoose the Right Setting: Find a quiet and private space to discuss the diagnosis, ensuring that you have enough time for the conversation without interruptions.\nEmpathetic Communication: Start by expressing empathy and understanding. Acknowledge the emotions they may be experiencing, which can include relief, shock, denial, or a range of other feelings.\nProvide Information: Explain the diagnosis clearly and in simple terms. Offer educational materials or resources that parents can take home and review at their own pace. This might include brochures, websites, or books.\nAnswer Questions: Encourage parents to ask questions and address any concerns they may have. Be patient and provide honest, accurate information to the best of your knowledge.\nOffer Emotional Support: Let parents know that their feelings are valid and that they are not alone. Mention local or online support groups or organizations where they can connect with other parents in similar situations.\nDiscuss Treatment and Intervention Options: Depending on the child’s needs, provide information about available treatment and intervention options. This might include therapies like Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA), speech therapy, occupational therapy, and more. Discuss the benefits and potential next steps.\nReferrals: If necessary, provide referrals to specialists or service providers who can further assess and assist the child. Explain the roles of these professionals and the importance of early intervention.\nDevelop a Care Plan: Work together with the parents to create a care plan tailored to their child’s specific needs and strengths. This plan may involve therapies, educational programs, and other services.\nLegal and Financial Guidance: Discuss any legal and financial matters, such as eligibility for government programs, insurance coverage, and educational rights, to ensure parents are aware of available resources.\nEncourage Advocacy: Encourage parents to become advocates for their child’s needs and rights. Provide information about special education services, Individualized Education Programs (IEPs), and the importance of being involved in their child’s educational journey.\nRecommend Reading Materials: Suggest books, articles, or online resources that can help parents better understand autism and learn strategies for supporting their child.\nFollow-Up: Schedule a follow-up appointment to check on the family’s progress, address any new questions, and assess how the child is responding to interventions.\n\nRemember that every family’s situation is unique, and the way they react to the diagnosis can vary greatly. Your support, understanding, and guidance can make a significant difference in helping parents navigate this challenging but important phase in their child’s life.",

They also reported experiencing behaviors associated with Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC) during their childhood and often feeling isolated and aloof from others, growing up.\nAlthough most people feel relief, it may also be accompanied with a feeling of guilt or grief over their life thus far, for they have to redefine themselves and their lifestyle.

    "text": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a way to talk about a group of complex brain-related conditions. These conditions can make it harder for people to communicate and behave in typical ways. In other words, it affects how they talk, interact with others, and act in various situations. Autism is called a “spectrum” since ASD can affect people differently, with some individuals experiencing milder challenges and others more significant ones. There are a range of possibilities, with each person’s experience being unique.\n\n\nAutism in children usually becomes noticeable around the age of 2 to 3 years, all though with increasing awareness, early identification is becoming more common these days.\nParents initially start noticing differences in the way the child plays, communicates and responds to the environment. Many children do not respond to their name or make eye contact. They may not use any words or stop using the few words they have been using till then. They may not be interested in the usual things other children are interested in. They may seem to be obsessed with some unusual ways of occupying themselves like watching fans go round and round, flapping their hands, rocking themselves, singing to themselves constantly, lining up play things etc.\nChildren often show unusual amounts of distress when they are disturbed or they need to go from one activity to the other. They appear preoccupied and may not notice the presence of other children or adults around them. Parents typically struggle to understand why the child is in constant distress.The child appears adamant, uncommunicative and becomes unmanageable.\nUsually this is the time when parents seek help from medical professionals. Pediatricians refer children to developmental pediatricians or developmental psychologists. The child may initially be identified to have a developmental delay and eventually handed a diagnosis of being on the Autism Spectrum.\n\n\n\nCurrently, we do not know the exact cause of autism, though the research points to a variety of factors – genetic, bilological and environmental - contributing to it. Since autism is caused by a variety of factors working together, and currently we do not understand which specific factors are working together in which specific ways to cause autism, there is no medical way to “cure” autism. However, with the help of various therapies, many people on the spectrum can learn to manage autism to a large extent, and with the help of caregivers, lead fulfilling lives.\n\n\n\nThe immediate implication of autism diagnosis for the parents is that they need to rethink their ideas of parenting and their expectations of the child. Children on the spectrum may have various neurological and physiological differences that cause them to experience the world very differently from other people. Parents need to be willing to learn about their child and how autism impacts them. They need to be open to learning about various therapies and educational approaches in order to learn to manage themselves and the child.\nIn the Indian context, where support from public institutions may be limited, a diagnosis of autism for the child may require the parents to radically rethink their lifestyle and goals. They may need to plan their lives such that one of the parents spends time with the child and coordinates with the doctors, therapists, school and other people who interact with the child.\n\n\n\nOnce there is a diagnosis, the next thing to do is to think of various ways to start working with the child. This usually takes the form of therapies - behavior therapies to start learning to understand and manage the general behavior of the child; speech and language therapy to start a channel of communication; occupational therapy or physical activities to help the child with physical regulation. The specific things that are done in each of the therapies depend on the specific challenges and needs of the child.\nWhichever of these therapies are chosen, one needs to ensure the therapies are aimed at making life easier for the child and the family. Over a period of time, the therapies are supposed to build the skills and competencies of the child, show the family how to work with the child, and over all, add to the quality of life of the family.\nIt also helps if parents continue to be involved in the therapies, understand the processes and learn the basic approaches, so that the child gets the same support whenever s/he needs it.\n\n\n\nSchooling and educational needs may vary according to the child’s capabilities, difficulties, needs and interests. Thus, it is important to first develop an Individualised Education Plan (IEP) for the child based on his/her strengths and difficulties. The IEP generally takes into account the strengths and difficulties of the child, as seen by different people working with the child - parents, therapists, teachers etc. - and outlines a plan to equip the child with required competencies.\nDepending on the specific needs of the child, a child may go on to a mainstream school with accommodations or go to a special school. Some children may need additional help. Homeschooling may also be an option in some cases.\n\n\n\nThe challenge with autism is that it is a spectrum condition, meaning it shows up in different ways in different people. The symptoms of autism may occur together or separately, with varying degrees of severity. This makes it difficult to characterize autism in a single uniform way. As they say, everyone’s autism is different and if you have seen one person with autism, you have only seen one person with autism.\nFor example, autism can cause severe coordination issues making a person unable to coordinate physical movements, leading to severe limitations in moving around, speaking and other motor planning activities. Autism may occur along with other neurological conditions like epilepsy. It can come along with conditions like anxiety, intellectual impairment, clinical depression, etc.\nEach of these difficulties may need to be addressed in specific ways. Finding these therapies and educational approaches, paying for them and practicing them may become overwhelming for the family. There is also a social aspect to this - the family may not have much time and energy to socialize and may also face some social resistance.\nOne of the significant issues a family faces as the child grows up is to be able to continue to understand, relate to and work with the person he/she is becoming. Another difficulty is to find people and institutions that can provide help and support as the person grows up to be a young adult. In India, most therapy centers work with young children up to 8-10 years of age. Most schools - either mainstream or special - expect 16 year olds to graduate and go out. There are very few institutions that provide meaningful alternatives and support beyond the teenage years.\n\n\n\nChildren with autism grow up to be adults with autism. While they do learn to manage their autism and be able to deal with the world in their own different ways, they will continue to have autism and may also need to have continued support.\nWhen one looks at the variety of difficulties, their varying levels and the different combinations they occur in, it stands to reason that there is a spectrum of outcomes as children grow up into adults. Some children grow up to be adults that need to depend on caregivers for basic health, hygiene and safety. Some children grow up to be adults that may be able to manage their own in controlled settings like homes and sheltered work spaces. Some children grow up to be able to physically manage themselves but may need continued emotional support to deal with the anxiety of being different from everyone else. A few children grow up to be able to manage like everyone else.\nAt present, the support and employment opportunities for autistic adults in India are still evolving and will need significant strengthening as we go forward.",

Children may not want to interact with peers or may not know how to take part in interactive games. They may behave inappropriately as they do not understand the rules of social behavior. For example, when in a play area, they may just follow other children around, copy their actions or snatch toys from others. So, teaching appropriate social behaviors and helping children cope with the demands of everyday social interactions at home, play areas and public places is another goal.",

    "text": "Key Focus\nIt is important to understand that the way a child experiences autism and the way it shows up through her behavior in the environment, comes from a combination of multiple factors. A child may not like the texture of food presented to her, may have a severe sensory response to it and may start feeling distressed. Now, she does not have language or other tools to communicate the same, does not understand the social behavior expected of her, and may start experiencing a serious emotional response. When a helpful adult tries to touch her, feed her, or talk to her, the added physical and verbal inputs further aggravate her distress. If she does not get help at this stage, she may resort to what is seen as ‘inappropriate behavior’ to communicate her distress. For the others around her, it looks like the child was offered tasty food, was encouraged to try out and taste it, but instead of doing what is expected, she has started closing her ears, shouting, kicking, and throwing the food around. However, the way she experiences the entire interaction is hugely different.\nAs we have seen above, these difficulties sometimes work together to produce profoundly difficult outcomes, and it is important to take all these areas into account while planning the goals for early intervention. The focus is to understand the variety of ways the child is distressed by the environment, trace the distress back to various difficulties the child has, and try address these difficulties, while building her skills and competencies.",

    "text": "A few guidelines\nYou should learn to critically evaluate the information you receive. Get information from objective sources.\n\nPeople promoting various treatments may really want to help your child but may also have additional business motives.\nAnyone making claims about “complete recovery” from autism or “curing” autism should be viewed with suspicion. There are no cures for autism.\nThe therapy approaches you choose should be evidence based. This means there should be enough scientific evidence that the approach works. Please remember that anecdotes are not evidence. Evidence-based practices include behavior approaches, developmental approaches like speech language therapy and occupational therapy.\nThe therapy approach or the combination of approaches you choose should be able to address all the goals mentioned above for the child. The therapy approach should enable you to get an assessment of your child’s specific needs in each of these areas and provide a comprehensive plan to progress on each of them.\nThe demands of the therapy approach should be aligned with your family’s capacity. For example, if a therapy approach needs you to spend more time with the child, you need to think of whether you can do this or not. It should also suit your financial ability.\nComplimentary approaches involving working with art, music, movement, animals, swimming, play should be treated as complimentary therapies. These can be practiced in addition to the evidence-based early intervention approaches above.\nMost methods of working with autism work slowly compared to the quick results one expects from medical treatments. That is the way it is. Anyone making time bound promises like “making your child school ready in six months” needs to be evaluated with caution.\nSince there are no medicines for the core symptoms of autism, one needs to be cautious about medication as a solution. Please evaluate the medication carefully. With young children, it may be best to avoid medication except in case of severe medical conditions like seizures.\nExtra caution is advised in using medication from ayurveda and other traditional medical systems. Most of these medications may be untested and unproven. Homeopathy may also be approached with caution – there are many controversies about whether it works at all. One of the problems with relying on unproven alternatives and medications is that these practices distract the family, divert attention from what needs to be done and may even interfere with the therapies.\nSimilarly, the efficacy of diets and supplements is at best questionable. An additional problem with restrictive diets is that children end up being deprived of many commonly consumed food items and may be nutritionally impacted. This feeling of deprivation may result in behaviors like grabbing food from others. Additionally, in the Indian culture where most social occasions revolve around food, children may also be socially impacted. While putting a child on a diet may look like an easy option, it may end up having profound consequences.\n\nIn summary, the key to choosing a good approach is to go with one that is evidence based, addresses the development needs of the child, and suits the family circumstances.",

We do not understand the reasons for these difficulties, but recognize that effective communication is important for everyone, and that speech is not the only way to communicate. It therefore makes sense to look beyond speech and enable everyone to find a channel of communication, using augmented and alternative communication (AAC) as necessary. AAC is a broad category that includes sign language, gestures, pictures, written words, and electronic devices.\nThis is not to say that speech is not necessary or important. Speaking and understanding spoken language can make life significantly easier for people on the spectrum and their families. However, considering the difficulties they have with communication and speech, limiting oneself to speech-only approaches can be counterproductive. It is advisable to explore the use of AAC for communication, as early as possible.\nAAC can provide a communication channel for people on the spectrum who have difficulties with speech and communication. It has been shown that even with people who speak, the use of AAC can make communication more effective, by providing a necessary scaffold. Also, the common apprehension that use of AAC stops children from acquiring speech is not true, as shown by a 2021 study, among others.\nIn summary, communication is a key element of working with autism and needs to be highly prioritized. People who find it difficult to speak should be supported with augmented and alternative communication as needed.",

These may include Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS), sign language or electronic devices.\nSpeech fluency – SLPs can help people on the spectrum with speech clarity, and fluency.\nArticulation – Speech requires coordination of different structures. SLPs can help improve the muscle strength, coordination and manipulation needed to produce speech.\nGrammar – many children on the spectrum struggle with grammar and sentence structure. SLPs can help them understand language\nFunctional Speech – echolalia, repetition of sounds, words and phrases is a common coping mechanism. SLPs can help in building functional speech.\nSocial skills – SLPs can help coach people on the spectrum to communicate in different settings, either in one-to-one sessions or group sessions.\nSocial communication – SLPs can help children use language for different purposes like demanding, informing, commenting.\nTransition to work – SLPs can also continue to help as the individual transitions to a work environment by coaching how to communicate in written and spoken forms.\n\nWhen working with an individual on the autism spectrum, SLPs assess strengths and challenges and develop a program with goals for the person and the approaches to achieve them. This program then becomes the basis for working together and assessing the effectiveness of the therapy.\nParents of children on the spectrum should understand that the goal of the SLP is to facilitate communication and be willing to prioritize functional communication.

Those who are oversensitive may find it difficult to sleep even with a little light around. People who are under sensitive to sound may prefer crowded, noisy places or bang doors and objects. Those that are oversensitive to sound may not be able to filter our background noises, leading to difficulties in concentrating. People under sensitive to smell may sometimes lick things to get a better sense. Those that are oversensitive may have difficulties using toilets or may dislike people with distinctive, strong perfumes. People under sensitive to taste may like very spicy food. They may also eat or mouth non-edible items such as stones, dirt, soil, feces etc. This is known as pica. People with sensitivities to taste may end up with a restrictive diet. People under sensitive to touch may hold others tightly, enjoy heavy objects like weighted blankets on top of them. They may have a high pain tolerance and may self-harm. Those oversensitive to touch may not like to be touched and may have difficulties brushing and washing hair. They may also tolerate only certain types of clothing or textures.",

Those that are oversensitive try to avoid that sensory input for the fear of being overwhelmed. People on the spectrum may need help in handling these sensitivities. The general approach is to provide manageable alternatives to the under sensitive system and to slowly desensitize the oversensitive system through gradual exposure. For example, if a child is easily overwhelmed by sounds, she may close her ears every time someone speaks to her, losing out on useful information and learning opportunities. The therapy approach in this case would be to offer her earmuffs that can decrease the intensity of the noise, couple the sound input with a visual and gradually help the child be comfortable with the sound of spoken voice. A child who is under sensitive to touch may keep scratching walls or rough surfaces for stimulation, causing injury to fingers and nails in the process. In this case, the therapist may offer a manageable alternative by giving her a polystyrene sheet to scratch and get the sensory input.",

    "text": "Sensory Integration Therapy\nOccupational therapists trained in dealing with sensory processing difficulties can help by providing interventions to target each sense, helping the child’s nervous system become more organized and regulated. Sensory integration therapy is one of the names given to such an approach. One of the options is to put a child on a sensory diet, a specially designed daily activity plan that provides the child with a variety of sensory activities. The focus is to help the child be regulated and improve attention and focus. When the child’s arousal level is too low, they can be given stimulating activities like dancing, singing, light exercise etc. When the arousal level is high, they can be given calming activities like going for a walk, reading, listening to music etc. It is important to choose activities that suit each child and provide the appropriate level of arousal or relaxation.\n\nSensory Circuits\nSensory circuits are another tool used by therapists to help children achieve a ready-to-learn state. Each session includes three elements.\n\nAlerting activities to stimulate the body’s central nervous system in preparation for learning. For example, spinning, bouncing on a gym ball, skipping, star jumps\nOrganizing activities which demand brain and body to work together. For example, balancing on a wobble board, log rolling, juggling\nCalming activities give an awareness of their body in space and increase the ability to self-regulate sensory input. For example, heavy muscle work and deep pressure like wall pushes, pushups, using weights.\n\nIn summary, some people on the spectrum may have sensory processing difficulties that make it difficult for them to process sensory information. Occupational therapists trained in sensory integration can help by designing sensory diets and other programs that can help children be more regulated, calmer, and focused, thereby reducing anxiety and increasing opportunities to thrive and achieve in the overwhelming environment in which we now live.",

The interoception center in our brains is called the insular cortex, which also plays a vital role in the perception of pain, primary emotions like joy, anger, awareness of bodily states like feeling of cold, and in the perception of being a self. Therefore, interoception difficulties may be responsible for emotional processing issues, problems in identifying and describing emotions, and difficulty with empathy and perspective taking. At an extremely basic level, people on the spectrum may not be able to recognize when they are thirsty, or hungry. They may not realize when they are full and may tend to overeat. They may find it difficult to self-regulate their emotions, attention, and behaviors. They may not be able to point to the source of their discomfort like where the pain is.\nInteroception can be improved by practicing interoception awareness activities like guided self-body scans, deep breathing, guided progressive relaxation.

This is the system that tells us if our head is upright or tilted, even with our eyes closed. Children who are oversensitive to this system can have fearful responses to ordinary movement activities like swings, slides, ramps etc. They may appear clumsy and fearful of moving in space. However, some children may actively seek intense sensory experiences such as excessive whirling, jumping, climbing heights, etc. Vestibular dysfunction can cause postural instability, gait dysfunction and impaired gaze. This can lead to delayed milestones such as sitting and walking and poor motor coordination. Vestibular dysfunction may be accompanied by auditory sensitivity and dysfunction.\nRepetitive actions like mild rocking can help calm down an over stimulated vestibular system. Providing structured activities that satisfy an under sensitive system seeking stimulation can also help.\nIn summary, the sensory processing disorder, and related difficulties in autism go beyond the five better known senses and may impact proprioception, interoception and vestibular system. The impact of these dysfunctions is still being researched and understood. An occupational therapist can provide sensory integration therapy to help with these difficulties.",

Meet other parents. This is because if you are unsure of the diagnosis, you will be unsure of what to do and that will waste time. Try and understand the rationale for the diagnosis and the recommendations.\nSecond, recognise that you need help both in terms of expertise about autism and your own emotional health. You are most likely to be someone who does not know about autism. This diagnosis has come as a shock to you. You need help to make sense of it. Find support groups. Seek the help of experts, other parents, counsellors or family members. Remember that your child needs you in good shape.\nThen, recognise that the child needs help. A child with autism has a different neurology than you. She may have sensory experiences that are very overwhelming. She might be struggling with social situations, and may have communication problems. While it might be difficult for neurotypical people to imagine these problems and their severity, these difficulties are real. Traditional parenting approaches may actually make it more difficult for the child. Also, every person on the spectrum has slightly different difficulties and experiences life differently. It is important for you as a parent to learn more autism, how it is impacting your child and then help her.\nAs you go ahead and make further decisions, remember that the objective is to help the child. The child needs help with sensory experiences, social issues and communication, at the very minimum. Every decision you make should be examined in the light of this question - how is this likely to help the child?\nLook for more information to make sense of autism and what your child is going through - If you are already on this resource page, you have made a start!\nUsually, the recommendation from developmental psychologists is to start therapies. Check the therapy centres around you. Examine their credentials and choose a good therapist. Here is a note on how to choose therapists. Once again, think about their recommendations and how they are going to help your child.\nWhile the therapies and the amount of help your child needs may look overwhelming at first, a lot can be done using common sense. Think of how you can skill yourself up. What can you do at your end? In the Indian context, most institutions that deal with children - preschools, schools, activity centres etc. - do not have much understanding of the needs of children on the spectrum. Remember that you cannot help other people working with the child unless you have a good sense of your child, her difficulties and how to respond to them.\nAll of this is going to require your time. Plan such that you are able to spend time with the child, interface with therapists and gradually develop an understanding of how to help her manage her daily life.\nIn summary, take care of yourself, understand your child and continue working. You can do this.",

Why is the history of any scientific idea important, for that matter?\nThe history of a scientific idea is important because science develops in the context of the challenges faced in a particular time and place. People who are doing science do not work in a vacuum, so what they notice and the way they interpret what they see, both depend on the context in which they are operating. However, when these interpretations become part of the science, they are sometimes seen to be somehow ‘objective’ by later day practitioners and students. This leads to a loss of context and inhibits the ability to critically examine older ideas, thereby giving them a longer life than they deserve.\nNowhere is this more visible than in the case of autism.\nThe acknowledged pioneer of autism research in the US was also the proponent of the claim that ‘refrigerator mothers’ caused autism. He focused on one specific end of the autism spectrum, ended up conveying the idea that it is a severely disabling, rare condition, and that led to a certain stigma around autism.\nAnother pioneer of autism, while he had a better understanding of the variety of autistic traits, had to focus on the ‘higher functioning’ end of the spectrum, as he worked in the Nazi regime that did not have a place for the ‘feeble minded’.\nWhile both are Germanic, they wrote in two different languages making it difficult to reconcile these two ideas. Both failed to acknowledge the work of brilliant clinicians, who, incidentally, worked with one first and then with the other.\nBoth might also have known about but ignored the seminal contributions of a Soviet Jewish woman psychologist, possibly due to antisemitism, sexist attitudes, and anti-Soviet sentiments. These contributions, if accounted for properly, would have made autism what it is today, but much earlier and with much less misery all around.\nComing a little later, a parent of an autistic child, who worked tirelessly to disprove ‘refrigerator mother’ theory was also a supporter of controversial programs and alternative treatments like chelation, use of aversive and believed in the vaccine-autism link which was later discredited.\nThen it took a British woman psychiatrist, also the mother of a severely autistic child, to bring these accounts together and help us see autism for the spectrum it is. It took the accounts of a few autistic adults like Temple Grandin and Judy Singer, movies like Rainman, the recent tireless work of journalists like Steve Silberman, as well as countless others, to put the idea of neurodiversity as the basis of looking at and understanding autism, as we do today.\nSo, yes, the history of autism is interesting and informative. Here is a TED talk by Steve Silberman that touches upon some of the developments in the history of autism.\n\nLet’s dive in for more detail!",

His influential work began in 1928 when he underwent psychiatric training and eventually joined John Hopkins University Hospital. Kanner’s contributions included establishing a child psychiatric unit, transforming the doctor-patient relationship perspective. In 1935, he authored “Child Psychiatry,” the first English-language textbook on the subject. During this time, he helped clinicians Anne Weiss and George Frankl to escape the Nazi regime in Germany. Frankl later joined Kanner at John Hopkins University.\nIn 1941, Kanner presented a paper titled “Autistic Disturbances with Affective Contact,” which was eventually published in 1943. This seminal work outlined observations of 11 children with common signs, including social isolation, a desire for sameness, routine obsession, delayed echolalia, and splinter memory skills. Kanner’s perspective on autism, as an infrequent and narrowly defined condition, influenced perceptions for years, contributing to precise diagnosis but potentially hindering a broader understanding of the spectrum.\nKanner proposed the concept of emotionally neglectful mothers (refrigerator mothers) in his observations of parents of children with autism. He suggested that cold and neglectful mothers might contribute to the development of autism in their children.",

    "text": "Ivar Lovaas – Applied Behavior Analysis - 1965\nIn 1965, Lovaas published a groundbreaking study, “A Stereotypic Language in Young Children,” focusing on behavior modification techniques for language deficits in children with autism. Emphasizing individualized treatment plans, he recognized the diversity of autism and stressed tailored interventions based on each child’s specific needs. Lovaas highlighted the importance of early intervention, acknowledging that addressing language deficits during early development could positively impact overall communication abilities in children with autism.\nHis study employed a data-driven approach, prioritizing the collection and analysis of objective data to evaluate the effectiveness of behavioral interventions. This commitment to empirical research became foundational to the scientific approach characteristic of Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA), which Lovaas and his colleagues further developed in the 1980s.\nWhile the 1965 study focused on language development, it set the stage for Lovaas’s comprehensive approach to autism treatment. Continuing his research and developing the Lovaas Method in the 1980s, he contributed to establishing ABA as a prominent, evidence-based intervention for individuals with autism.\nABA involves breaking down complex behaviors into smaller components and using reinforcement strategies to encourage desired behaviors while discouraging undesirable ones. The Lovaas Method features intensive one-on-one behavioral therapy, often exceeding 40 hours per week, with a focus on structured learning, positive reinforcement, and individualized goals. Grounded in empirical research, Lovaas’s work, including the 1987 study “Behavioral treatment and normal educational and intellectual functioning in young autistic children,” played a crucial role in establishing ABA as a leading intervention for autism.",

    "text": "Hans Asperger – the other end – 1944\nHans Asperger (1906-1980), an Austrian pediatrician born in Vienna. He pursued medicine and received his medical degree in 1931 from the University of Vienna. He joined the University Children’s Clinic in Vienna. His mentor and supervisor at the clinic for the most part was Franz Hamburger, a prominent Austrian pediatrician. Under Hamburger’s guidance, Asperger had the opportunity to observe and work with a diverse range of pediatric cases.\nAsperger’s work on autism was influenced not only by his medical training but also by the clinical experiences and mentorship he received during his tenure at the University Children’s Clinic. His colleagues had a unique way of treating children with special needs and they tried to adopt new ways of teaching and learning for those children. The collaboration between Asperger and Hamburger thus played a crucial role in shaping Asperger’s understanding of child development and psychopathology, contributing to the pioneering observations that would later define his work on autism.\nDuring his tenure at the Children’s Clinic in Vienna, Asperger extensively studied over 200 children. These children displayed a range of symptoms, from prodigious abilities coupled with struggles in school to more severe disabilities that led to institutionalization. Despite the diversity, they all shared common features such as precocious talents, social awkwardness, and an intense focus on laws, rules, and schedules.\nIn 1944, Hans Asperger published a groundbreaking paper titled “Die ‘Autistischen Psychopathen’ im Kindesalter” (“The ‘Autistic Psychopaths’ in Childhood”). This seminal work detailed his observations and conceptualization of a distinctive set of behaviors displayed by certain children, which are now recognized as falling within the autism spectrum.\nAsperger adopted a holistic understanding, viewing autism as a variation in neurodevelopment rather than a disorder. Crucially, Asperger recognized that these symptoms existed on a continuum, affecting both children and adults. He also keenly noted that the symptoms were noticeable in children only when they were 2 years old or older. Additionally, his work acknowledged the lifelong implications of autism but also expressed optimism about individuals leading fulfilling lives with appropriate support.\nWhen Asperger eventually shared his research with the world, he chose to highlight his higher-functioning patients. This decision was influenced by the era he lived in, marked by the Nazis’ pursuit of purifying the land of the “feebleminded,” leading to the euthanization of many institutionalized children. Consequently, Asperger unintentionally conveyed the impression that autism was a rare condition affecting young geniuses, rather than the more common syndrome he had identified. However, despite its significance, the paper did not gain widespread recognition initially, due to the language barrier and the second world war.",

Psychologist Anne Weiss was also a part of the staff at the clinic. Both published papers in 1934-35, which included descriptions of children who had same characteristics as autism. They were working closely with Asperger. Both were jews, and they escaped the Nazi regime in 1935-37. Asperger was named the head of the clinic in 1935.\nFrankl and Weiss, who later married each other went to work with Leo Kanner in 1938. Kanner’s paper titled “Autistic Disturbances of Affective Contact” was published in August 1941. Asperger’s paper, which Lorna Wing translated in 1981, was first submitted as a postdoctoral thesis in 1942 and was published in 1944.\nIt is difficult to imagine Kanner was unaware of Asperger’s work, while definitive evidence is not available.

    "text": "Lorna Wing – Bringing the ends together\nBuilding on the work of Leo Kanner and Hans Asperger, Lorna Wing proposed the concept of the “autism spectrum.” She emphasized that autism is a spectrum of disorders with a wide range of presentations, including different degrees of severity and a diverse set of characteristics. Adding on, Wing also introduced the concept of the “triad of impairments” to describe the core features of autism. This triad includes difficulties in social interaction, communication, and imagination (often manifested as repetitive and stereotyped behaviors). The triad of impairments became a foundational framework for understanding and diagnosing autism spectrum disorders. Along with Judith Gould, she also developed the Autism Diagnostic Interview (ADI), a structured interview for parents or caregivers of individuals with autism. The ADI became an essential tool for clinicians and researchers in diagnosing autism and gathering information about a person’s behavior and development.\nWing, apart from actively being involved in advocating for individuals with autism and their families, contributed to better recognition and understanding of autism in girls and women by highlighting the underrepresentation of females on the autism spectrum. Her work drew attention to the fact that autism might present differently in females compared to males.\nHer work has had a lasting impact on autism research, diagnosis, and support systems.",

    "text": "Grunya Sukhareva – overlooked pioneer – 1925\nSukhareva, a Soviet child psychiatrist, independently observed children displaying social withdrawal, language difficulties, and repetitive behaviors. Her detailed description of autistic features in the six boys she observed was published in 1925, nearly two decades before the more widely known work of Asperger and Kanner. Sukhareva recognized the unique cognitive profiles of the children she studied, emphasizing differences in information processing and engagement with the world. Her focus on early childhood and the importance of early identification and intervention aligns with later perspectives on autism.\nSukhareva held a positive view regarding children’s ability to adapt successfully under favorable conditions. She emphasized the significance of the social environment, proper upbringing, and education in stimulating compensatory opportunities for children.\nSukhareva, as a child psychiatrist, observed and highlighted how crucial these factors were in aiding children’s adaptation within their families and at school. This perspective aligned with her evolutionary-biological concept of mental illness. In her 1926 paper, Sukhareva balanced her descriptions by also noting unconventional behavior and challenges faced by the children she observed.\nSukhareva also documented motor coordination issues in some children, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of autism that recognizes the diverse challenges individuals may face. Overall, Sukhareva’s pioneering work laid a foundation for the evolving understanding of autism.\nSula Wolff, a psychiatrist based in Edinburgh, praised Sukhareva’s 1926 publication, stating that Sukhareva summarized the children’s characteristics “admirably” and described her work as “marvellous.” According to Manouilenko and Bejerot, Sukhareva’s descriptions were considered “structured, elegant, detailed,” and “vivid.” They also noted that Sukhareva’s ideas on ways to help autistic children were remarkably “modern.”\nManouilenko and Bejerot suggest that Sukhareva’s gender, her Jewish identity, Russian nationality, and her publications in Russian and German were not an effective combination for gaining worldwide attention in the 1920s. One can only bemoan the loss to the autism community, clearly due to the established discrimination.",
