# Forums

Forum is a place where questions can be asked and answered. 

We set up a separate forum for each of the disabilities. Users are able to choose which forum they want to go to, from this page. 

Each forum page provides an interface to ask and answer questions. Frequently asked questions can be setup and when a question is asked, previous related questions and answers can also be shown.
